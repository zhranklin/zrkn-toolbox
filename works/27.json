hall.\r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,230\r\nI'm Emmanuel Pahud, principal\r\nflute of the Berlin\r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,980\r\nPhilharmonic, and hosting here\r\nin the intermission of this\r\n\r\n6\r\n00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,420\r\nconcert, the conductor,\r\nAlan Gilbert.\r\n\r\n7\r\n00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,500\r\nWelcome.\r\n\r\n8\r\n00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,610\r\nThanks for joining us.\r\n\r\n9\r\n00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,520\r\nNow, tell us a little bit what\r\nit's been like for you coming\r\n\r\n10\r\n00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,910\r\nback for this program\r\nhere to Berlin.\r\n\r\n11\r\n00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,700\r\nYou've been here three years\r\nago, as you stepped in for\r\n\r\n12\r\n00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,980\r\nBernard Haitink in a very short\r\namount of time, where\r\n\r\n13\r\n00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,955\r\nyou were playing a\r\nSchumann symphony\r\n\r\n14\r\n00:00:29,955 --> 00:00:30,970\r\nand a Brahms symphony.\r\n\r\n15\r\n00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,540\r\nI think it was Schumann\r\nThird and Brahms'\r\n\r\n16\r\n00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,480\r\nThird, is that correct?\r\n\r\n17\r\n00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,310\r\nSchumann One.\r\n\r\n18\r\n00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,970\r\nSchumann One, and\r\nBrahms' Third.\r\n\r\n19\r\n00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,540\r\nIt was a beautiful experience\r\ntogether with you.\r\n\r\n20\r\n00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,470\r\nSo we're happy to welcome\r\nyou back.\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,461\r\nAnd how does that\r\nfeel for you?\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:43,650\r\nWell, connecting with the Berlin\r\nPhilharmonic is, I\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,030\r\nthink, every conductor's\r\ndream.\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,010\r\nAnd so when I had that chance a\r\nfew years ago, in a way, the\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,910\r\ngood thing was that I only had\r\nthree days to prepare for it.\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,200\r\nOf course, that was also\r\nthe bad thing.\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,750\r\nBut emotionally, not to have to\r\nspend months worrying about\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,380\r\nit and just dive in and say,\r\nOK, let's see what happens.\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,110\r\nAnd hope it goes well.\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,610\r\nThat was actually probably a\r\nhealthy way to have my first\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,480\r\nexperience here.\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,020\r\nI loved it.\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:07,910\r\nI had a wonderful time.\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,190\r\nIt's a marvelous orchestra.\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,320\r\nI've always enjoyed listening\r\nto the orchestra when I've\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,810\r\nheard it play.\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,970\r\nI've heard it in a couple of\r\ndifferent cities, mostly New\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,130\r\nYork, of course.\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,790\r\nBut the experience of\r\nworking with the\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,680\r\norchestra was really thrilling.\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,360\r\nBecause you have the impression\r\nthat when you offer\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,480\r\nsomething or when you ask for\r\nsomething, it comes back fully\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,810\r\nrealized from the orchestra.\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,730\r\nSo it's a very challenging\r\norchestra in a way to conduct,\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,600\r\nbut also a very easy\r\norchestra.\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,300\r\nBecause it gives much,\r\nit offers so much.\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,910\r\nAnd there's so much\r\nto react to.\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,820\r\nThis program, of course,\r\nis a very\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,810\r\ndifferent kind of program.\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,560\r\nWonderful, equally wonderful,\r\nbut all Czech music.\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,040\r\nAnd since I had such a nice\r\nexperience last time, I've\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,320\r\nenjoyed the preparation\r\nfor this concert.\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,640\r\nAnd I've looked forward\r\nto this very much.\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,230\r\nAnd the rehearsals so far\r\nhave been a pleasure.\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,180\r\nI'm sure that many listeners,\r\nworld wide concert goers here\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,090\r\nin Berlin in the Philharmonic,\r\nand people logging in into the\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,230\r\ndigital concert hall, are\r\nwondering, why do we play a\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,880\r\nCzech program together\r\nwith you?\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,970\r\nDid you choose the pieces?\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,500\r\nHave you been asked\r\nto illustrate\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,170\r\nmusic from Middle Europe?\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,210\r\nWell, I like to do a huge\r\nrange of music.\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,120\r\nAnd the Martinu symphony\r\nis a piece I've\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,350\r\nloved for a long time.\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,970\r\nAnd believe it or not, one of\r\nthe times I did the piece\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,370\r\nrecently, I thought,\r\nyou know what?\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,200\r\nThis would be a wonderful\r\npiece to do in Berlin.\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,480\r\nI thought, it's a perfect piece\r\nfor the imagination of\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,180\r\ncolor and the sound sense\r\nthat this orchestra has.\r\n\r\n70\r\n00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,490\r\nIt happens to be a Martinu\r\nanniversary year.\r\n\r\n71\r\n00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,080\r\nThat's, in a way, incidental.\r\n\r\n72\r\n00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,580\r\nAnd once we had the Martinu\r\nsymphony idea basically set,\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,640\r\nthen we decided to take the\r\nCzech idea and run with it.\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,940\r\nAnd we came up with these\r\nother pieces.\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,600\r\nDvorak, of course, is probably\r\nthe best known\r\n\r\n76\r\n00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,900\r\nof the Czech composers.\r\n\r\n77\r\n00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,270\r\nAnd the Cello Concerto is\r\none of the most beloved.\r\n\r\n78\r\n00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:18,880\r\nBut the later tone poems, of\r\nwhich the Noon Day Witch is\r\n\r\n79\r\n00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,850\r\none, are just amazing works.\r\n\r\n80\r\n00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:27,820\r\nHe really started to change\r\nhis style of composing.\r\n\r\n81\r\n00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,540\r\nYou could say that, he was\r\nalways a great composer, but\r\n\r\n82\r\n00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,600\r\nhe was really going into\r\na new direction.\r\n\r\n83\r\n00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,720\r\nAnd you can almost see how\r\nJanacek, who came after,\r\n\r\n84\r\n00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,940\r\npicked up where Dvorak\r\nleft off.\r\n\r\n85\r\n00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,940\r\nAnd these late tone poems are\r\non metaphysical, kind of\r\n\r\n86\r\n00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,890\r\nsupernatural themes.\r\n\r\n87\r\n00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,680\r\nThe stories are unusual.\r\n\r\n88\r\n00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,470\r\nAnd actually, this particular\r\nstory is quite horrible.\r\n\r\n89\r\n00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,480\r\nIt's about the death of\r\na child, in fact.\r\n\r\n90\r\n00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:02,490\r\nBut he really started to\r\ncatapult, I think, Czech music\r\n\r\n91\r\n00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,590\r\ninto a completely\r\nnew territory.\r\n\r\n92\r\n00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,290\r\nSo you see, for instance in this\r\nmusical illustration of\r\n\r\n93\r\n00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,090\r\nthe terrible story of the Noon\r\nWitch, you don't see only a\r\n\r\n94\r\n00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,040\r\npurpose for writing some music\r\nthat would illustrate this,\r\n\r\n95\r\n00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,350\r\nbut really something structural\r\nabout the musical\r\n\r\n96\r\n00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,760\r\nlanguage that Dvorak used\r\nin these tone poems.\r\n\r\n97\r\n00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,470\r\nAnd that opened a new\r\nway for Czech music.\r\n\r\n98\r\n00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,980\r\nI think that's right.\r\n\r\n99\r\n00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,730\r\nIt's very operatic.\r\n\r\n100\r\n00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:34,130\r\nIt's very clear what the story\r\nis about, and what the musical\r\n\r\n101\r\n00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,410\r\nelements refer to.\r\n\r\n102\r\n00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,990\r\nYou hear this little oboe, going\r\npe-pe-pe, and that's the\r\n\r\n103\r\n00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:39,950\r\nchild crying.\r\n\r\n104\r\n00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,560\r\nAnd then you can tell when the\r\nmother, who was sitting with\r\n\r\n105\r\n00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,060\r\nthe child, becomes stern\r\nand starts to scold the\r\n\r\n106\r\n00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,240\r\nchild, no, be quiet.\r\n\r\n107\r\n00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,230\r\nDon't do that.\r\n\r\n108\r\n00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,300\r\nAnd threatens the child.\r\n\r\n109\r\n00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,970\r\nIt's the old fashioned\r\nway of parenting.\r\n\r\n110\r\n00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,190\r\nI don't think that's the\r\nway we're supposed\r\n\r\n111\r\n00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,310\r\nto do it these days.\r\n\r\n112\r\n00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,170\r\nAnd threatens the child\r\nwith the Noon Witch.\r\n\r\n113\r\n00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,240\r\nIf you don't shut up, the Noon\r\nWitch will come and get you.\r\n\r\n114\r\n00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,350\r\nAnd you hear this scary,\r\nominous music.\r\n\r\n115\r\n00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,940\r\nIt's very clear.\r\n\r\n116\r\n00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,410\r\nYou can't miss it.\r\n\r\n117\r\n00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,560\r\nAnd then things become calm and\r\nnormal, domestic again.\r\n\r\n118\r\n00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,940\r\nAnd the baby starts\r\nto cry again.\r\n\r\n119\r\n00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,780\r\nAnd then you get this\r\nthreat again.\r\n\r\n120\r\n00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,320\r\nAnd then, of course, what\r\nhappens is in this bizarre,\r\n\r\n121\r\n00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,670\r\nromantic kind of supernatural\r\nway, the threat of the Noon\r\n\r\n122\r\n00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,060\r\nDay Witch actually becomes\r\na reality.\r\n\r\n123\r\n00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,610\r\nAnd when the father, completely\r\nunsuspecting, comes\r\n\r\n124\r\n00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,890\r\nhome at the end of the piece,\r\nyou can really tell that\r\n\r\n125\r\n00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,290\r\nmusic, too.\r\n\r\n126\r\n00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:31,150\r\nHe's just ambling along, kind\r\nof, everything is cool.\r\n\r\n127\r\n00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,020\r\nEverything is normal.\r\n\r\n128\r\n00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:37,380\r\nWhat he discovers is the work\r\nthat the Noon Day Witch,\r\n\r\n129\r\n00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,960\r\nprobably representing death.\r\n\r\n130\r\n00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,560\r\nBut it's not really clear where\r\nreality is and where\r\n\r\n131\r\n00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,080\r\nfantasy is.\r\n\r\n132\r\n00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,650\r\nThey become kind of\r\nmixed together.\r\n\r\n133\r\n00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,240\r\nIn any case, it's\r\na pictorial--\r\n\r\n134\r\n00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,505\r\nit's a mini opera.\r\n\r\n135\r\n00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:55,820\r\nIt's a mini opera, and\r\na very strong piece.\r\n\r\n136\r\n00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,050\r\nI'd like to hear some words from\r\nyou about the two other\r\n\r\n137\r\n00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,900\r\nworks from the program about the\r\nCello Concerto by Dvorak\r\n\r\n138\r\n00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,340\r\nand about the Martinu\r\nSymphony no.\r\n\r\n139\r\n00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:05,670\r\n4.\r\n\r\n140\r\n00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,650\r\nBoth of them were written\r\nin the US,\r\n\r\n141\r\n00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,680\r\nwere written in America.\r\n\r\n142\r\n00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,390\r\nYou are a New Yorker.\r\n\r\n143\r\n00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,000\r\nYou are also from next season.\r\n\r\n144\r\n00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,060\r\nI should have claimed that.\r\n\r\n145\r\n00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,370\r\nThat's why we did this program,\r\nobviously, because of\r\n\r\n146\r\n00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,190\r\nthese pieces having been\r\nwritten in the States.\r\n\r\n147\r\n00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,330\r\nNo, not at all.\r\n\r\n148\r\n00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:26,830\r\nThere might be something about\r\nthese pieces from these\r\n\r\n149\r\n00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:33,380\r\nemigrants, and wanting to offer\r\nthe audience in the US\r\n\r\n150\r\n00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,430\r\nand offer the commissioners in\r\nthe US, certainly, a piece of\r\n\r\n151\r\n00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,240\r\ntheir own life, of their\r\nown history.\r\n\r\n152\r\n00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,190\r\nThe Martinu Symphony no.\r\n\r\n153\r\n00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,940\r\n4 has been written, or\r\ncompleted, in 1945, just at\r\n\r\n154\r\n00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,150\r\nthe end of World War II,\r\nor just after the end\r\n\r\n155\r\n00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,930\r\nof World War II.\r\n\r\n156\r\n00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:50,550\r\nWell, it's clearly a reaction\r\nto the war, this piece.\r\n\r\n157\r\n00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:56,390\r\nIt's also a kind of story in a\r\nsymphony, very differently\r\n\r\n158\r\n00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,370\r\nrealized from the Dvorak\r\ntone poem.\r\n\r\n159\r\n00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:05,530\r\nBut you can hear in the first\r\nmovement, I believe, a kind of\r\n\r\n160\r\n00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:11,140\r\ncarefree optimism that is\r\nshattered by the war-like\r\n\r\n161\r\n00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,530\r\nsecond movement.\r\n\r\n162\r\n00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,610\r\nAnd then the third movement\r\ngoes into a kind of\r\n\r\n163\r\n00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,160\r\nreflective, spiritual realm.\r\n\r\n164\r\n00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,180\r\nAnd you can feel the difficulty\r\nat the beginning of\r\n\r\n165\r\n00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,410\r\nthe last movement that\r\nultimately gives way to\r\n\r\n166\r\n00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,560\r\njubilation and relief at\r\nthe passing of the war.\r\n\r\n167\r\n00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,640\r\nI really think that's what\r\nthe symphony is about.\r\n\r\n168\r\n00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,980\r\nThere's a lot of celebrations,\r\nof course, of composers,\r\n\r\n169\r\n00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,210\r\nElliott Carter's 100th\r\nanniversary.\r\n\r\n170\r\n00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,180\r\nWe're playing a lot of Carter\r\nin Berlin these days.\r\n\r\n171\r\n00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,070\r\nIt's a joint initiative of the\r\nBerlin Philharmonic and Daniel\r\n\r\n172\r\n00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,250\r\nBarenboim with his\r\nStaatskapelle, also.\r\n\r\n173\r\n00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,230\r\nBut of course, also,\r\nMendelssohn year.\r\n\r\n174\r\n00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,960\r\nAnd we had Messiaen last year.\r\n\r\n175\r\n00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,340\r\nThere's going to be Schumann\r\nnext year, also.\r\n\r\n176\r\n00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,530\r\nThere's a lot going on.\r\n\r\n177\r\n00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,870\r\nThen Mahler is profiling,\r\nalso, lots of jubilees.\r\n\r\n178\r\n00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,000\r\nBut certainly, the Martinu is\r\nvery important, also, to\r\n\r\n179\r\n00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,380\r\nhighlight, and this composer who\r\nis certainly underexposed.\r\n\r\n180\r\n00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,920\r\nI think you see a lot of\r\nprogramming based on\r\n\r\n181\r\n00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,900\r\nanniversaries, which in a\r\nway is understandable.\r\n\r\n182\r\n00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,480\r\nBut it's also not the most\r\nexciting motivation, I feel.\r\n\r\n183\r\n00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,440\r\nHowever, in the case of a\r\ncomposer, a master composer\r\n\r\n184\r\n00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,900\r\nsuch as Martinu who is not as\r\nwell known, and whose music is\r\n\r\n185\r\n00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,710\r\nperhaps not as widely performed\r\nas it should, I\r\n\r\n186\r\n00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,710\r\nthink it's actually useful to\r\ntake the opportunity, to take\r\n\r\n187\r\n00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,010\r\nthe excuse of having an\r\nanniversary to say, don't\r\n\r\n188\r\n00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,130\r\nforget about this music.\r\n\r\n189\r\n00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:45,080\r\nAnd also, we came to your hall\r\nto visit [INAUDIBLE]\r\n\r\n190\r\n00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,500\r\nof yourself and your orchestra\r\nin Stockholm on our last tour\r\n\r\n191\r\n00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,290\r\nwith the Berlin Philharmonic,\r\nwhen we went to the Baltic Sea\r\n\r\n192\r\n00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,930\r\nfor, I think it was our first\r\ntour of the Baltic Sea in the\r\n\r\n193\r\n00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,760\r\npost-war years, and which\r\nallowed us to visit some\r\n\r\n194\r\n00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,110\r\ncountries that were not even\r\nexisting at that time.\r\n\r\n195\r\n00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,520\r\nBut it was really a great\r\npleasure to play in the\r\n\r\n196\r\n00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,010\r\nwonderful acoustic of the\r\nhall in Stockholm.\r\n\r\n197\r\n00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,410\r\nAnd how was that experience for\r\nyou, to hear the Berlin\r\n\r\n198\r\n00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,340\r\nPhilharmonic coming to you?\r\n\r\n199\r\n00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,690\r\nWell, I was really happy\r\nthat I was able\r\n\r\n200\r\n00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,580\r\nto be at that concert.\r\n\r\n201\r\n00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,310\r\nOne of the things that I tried\r\nto do while I was in\r\n\r\n202\r\n00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,865\r\nStockholm--\r\n\r\n203\r\n00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:20,430\r\nI've finished my\r\nposition there.\r\n\r\n204\r\n00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,190\r\nSo I'm no longer with\r\nthe orchestra.\r\n\r\n205\r\n00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:27,410\r\nBut the concert hall and the\r\norchestra are run by the same\r\n\r\n206\r\n00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,540\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n207\r\n00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,800\r\nAnd early in the time that I was\r\nthere, there were very few\r\n\r\n208\r\n00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,670\r\nvisiting orchestras.\r\n\r\n209\r\n00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,590\r\nI think there are a number\r\nof reasons for that.\r\n\r\n210\r\n00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,380\r\nBut certainly, I think one thing\r\nthat I tried to change\r\n\r\n211\r\n00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,150\r\nand to encourage during the\r\ntime I was there is the\r\n\r\n212\r\n00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,660\r\npresence, the constant\r\npresence of visiting\r\n\r\n213\r\n00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,140\r\norchestras.\r\n\r\n214\r\n00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,770\r\nAnd of course, if an orchestra\r\nsuch as Berlin can come,\r\n\r\n215\r\n00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,370\r\nthat's a privilege for\r\nthe city to hear.\r\n\r\n216\r\n00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,850\r\nAnd also, it's nice for our\r\norchestra as well, to have\r\n\r\n217\r\n00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,150\r\nthat kind of musical activity\r\nand that kind of focus on the\r\n\r\n218\r\n00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,110\r\nhall where we play.\r\n\r\n219\r\n00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,920\r\nAnd I know there were many\r\nmusicians from my orchestra\r\n\r\n220\r\n00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,480\r\nwho were able to come\r\nto the concert.\r\n\r\n221\r\n00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,320\r\nIt was a great program.\r\n\r\n222\r\n00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,040\r\nIt was an unusual program.\r\n\r\n223\r\n00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,920\r\nI remember particularly the\r\nWebern Six Pieces, and the\r\n\r\n224\r\n00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,290\r\nStravinsky Symphony in\r\nThree Movements.\r\n\r\n225\r\n00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,770\r\nIt was an unusual progression.\r\n\r\n226\r\n00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,140\r\nBut I think it worked\r\nvery well.\r\n\r\n227\r\n00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,300\r\nAnd of course, it gave\r\nthe orchestra many\r\n\r\n228\r\n00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,120\r\nways to show itself.\r\n\r\n229\r\n00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,990\r\nWe now also have a residency in\r\nCarnegie Hall, where we are\r\n\r\n230\r\n00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,190\r\nreturning every two\r\nor three years.\r\n\r\n231\r\n00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:29,130\r\nAnd that will allow us to see\r\neach other, hopefully, if\r\n\r\n232\r\n00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,120\r\nyou're around, also at the same\r\ntime, very soon in the\r\n\r\n233\r\n00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,570\r\nfuture, not only in Berlin\r\nbut also in New York.\r\n\r\n234\r\n00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,570\r\nAnd I hope that, knowing that\r\nyou're going to be very busy\r\n\r\n235\r\n00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,740\r\nin New York with the New York\r\nPhilharmonic from next\r\n\r\n236\r\n00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,485\r\nSeptember, that you will find\r\nsome time and visit us again.\r\n\r\n237\r\n00:10:43,485 --> 00:10:44,040\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n238\r\n00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,920\r\nIt's been a pleasure.\r\n\r\n239\r\n00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,390\r\nAnd one of the nice things about\r\nbuilding relationships\r\n\r\n240\r\n00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,250\r\nwith orchestras is that you\r\nstart to have friends in the\r\n\r\n241\r\n00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:51,900\r\nvarious orchestras.\r\n\r\n242\r\n00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,740\r\nAnd now I think even in addition\r\nto you, I have quite\r\n\r\n243\r\n00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,870\r\na lot of people whom I\r\ncan consider friends.\r\n\r\n244\r\n00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,670\r\nAnd it will be a pleasure to\r\nmeet you here or in New York\r\n\r\n245\r\n00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,140\r\nor wherever.\r\n\r\n246\r\n00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,160\r\nThanks very much.\r\n\r\n247\r\n00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,130\r\nAnd now back to the concert\r\nfor the second half of the\r\n\r\n248\r\n00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,180\r\nbroadcast of the Digital\r\nConcert Hall.\r\n\r\n249\r\n00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,430\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\n250\r\n00:11:10,430 -->
