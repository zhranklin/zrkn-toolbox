Maurizio,\r\n\r\n8\r\n00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,020\r\nand old friends in the\r\norchestra as well.\r\n\r\n9\r\n00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,610\r\nHow does it feel to come back\r\nand bring everyone together?\r\n\r\n10\r\n00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,385\r\nIt's always a great, great\r\npleasure to make music, to see\r\n\r\n11\r\n00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:29,390\r\nall the friends again.\r\n\r\n12\r\n00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,590\r\nOf course, with Maurizio\r\nso many years.\r\n\r\n13\r\n00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,220\r\nHow many years do you\r\nknow each other?\r\n\r\n14\r\n00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:40,180\r\nAlmost a half century, and we\r\nplay so many concertos from\r\n\r\n15\r\n00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,360\r\nMozart, Nono, and Brahms,\r\nBeethoven,\r\n\r\n16\r\n00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,200\r\nall Beethoven's concertos.\r\n\r\n17\r\n00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,360\r\nYou've played everything, I\r\nthink, together that there is.\r\n\r\n18\r\n00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,350\r\nWe play many things.\r\n\r\n19\r\n00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,320\r\nNot everything.\r\n\r\n20\r\n00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,160\r\nNot everything.\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,990\r\nA good number of concertos.\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,170\r\nQuite a good collaboration.\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,160\r\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,880\r\nBut tonight's concerto is one\r\nthat you haven't played\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,120\r\ntogether, is that right?\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,740\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,600\r\nNo, it's right.\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,850\r\nWe haven't played together.\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,430\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,680\r\nIt's a marvelous concerto.\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,060\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:15,530\r\nI didn't play it for a few\r\nyears, and hearing now these\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:21,040\r\nsounds, the marvelous sound of\r\nMozart so well played by the\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,310\r\norchestra was really a great joy\r\nfor me, like a discovery.\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,860\r\nI really know very well\r\nthe concerto.\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:33,130\r\nIt's one of those perhaps not\r\nplayed so often, but it's one\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,840\r\nof the most beautiful\r\nconcertos by Mozart.\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,100\r\nDoesn't require a timpani\r\nand trumpets.\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,280\r\nIt's more a chamber concerto.\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,890\r\nBut the invention is so\r\nextraordinary, for instance,\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,540\r\nthe invention of the third\r\nmovement, the variation.\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,820\r\nThis is already going into the\r\nline that Beethoven will\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,610\r\nfollow later.\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,420\r\nIt's an extraordinary way of\r\ncomposing a variation.\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,140\r\nAnd the second movement with\r\nall the modulation is\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,770\r\nabsolutely magical, one of the\r\ngreat movements of Mozart.\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,180\r\nThere's quite a lot of light\r\nand shade in this concerto.\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,680\r\nIt starts so happy, and then\r\nall of a sudden, it gets a\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,660\r\nlittle bit shadowy.\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,760\r\nIt is basically a\r\nhappy concerto,\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,690\r\nbut it has also shadows.\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,370\r\nCan you two remember the first\r\ntime you played together?\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,650\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,840\r\nChopin?\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:02:30,840

Lulu.\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,530\r\nMm-hm.\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,680\r\nIn Caracas.\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,420\r\nIn Venezuela.\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,120\r\nOoh, that's a nice place\r\nfor a [INAUDIBLE].\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,517\r\nYeah, with Simon Bolivar\r\nOrchestra, with Abreu.\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:50,311\r\nFantastic.\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:52,850\r\nAnd, I believe, Anna and\r\nMaurizio, you'll be playing\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:02:52,850 -->

00:04:42,790\r\nYou like them all.\r\n\r\n108\r\n00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,260\r\nIt's like when someone says,\r\nwhat's your favorite composer?\r\n\r\n109\r\n00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,940\r\nAnd I always think, depends\r\non the mood.\r\n\r\n110\r\n00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,180\r\nImpossible question.\r\n\r\n111\r\n00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,770\r\nImpossible, yes.\r\n\r\n112\r\n00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,210\r\nBut you must have had some\r\ngreat tours in your time.\r\n\r\n113\r\n00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,450\r\nWhat you do when you're\r\nnot playing?\r\n\r\n114\r\n00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,630\r\nWhat do you do after\r\nthe concert?\r\n\r\n115\r\n00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,790\r\nYou go out and eat great\r\nItalian food?\r\n\r\n116\r\n00:04:58,790 -->

possible.\r\n\r\n120\r\n00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,550\r\nSometimes it's not possible.\r\n\r\n121\r\n00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:10,800\r\nIn holiday times when\r\nmany things going

00:05:17,160\r\nSome musicians just like\r\nto work, work, work.\r\n\r\n125\r\n00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:24,170\r\nOr visiting towns and cities\r\nand monuments, or\r\n\r\n126\r\n00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,650\r\nbeing in the theater.\r\n\r\n127\r\n00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,880\r\nThere are many, many things.\r\n\r\n128\r\n00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,010\r\nOr being with

together.\r\n\r\n134\r\n00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,530\r\nI don't know if we\r\nmake holidays, or\r\n\r\n135\r\n00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,640\r\nsometimes we prepare.\r\n\r\n136\r\n00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,600\r\nI remember when we prepared the\r\nBeethoven Piano Concerto\r\n\r\n137\r\n00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,305\r\nfor Berlin, that we were\r\nworking in [INAUDIBLE].\r\n\r\n138\r\n00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,685\r\nYou did a lot together here\r\nin Berlin, didn't you?\r\n\r\n139\r\n00:05:48,685 --> 00:05:49,000\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n140\r\n00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,430\r\nIs it one of your favorite\r\norchestras to work with?\r\n\r\n141\r\n00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,680\r\nI hope you say yes.\r\n\r\n142\r\n00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,200\r\n\r\n143\r\n00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,320\r\nIt's one of the--\r\n\r\n144\r\n00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,720\r\nLogical.\r\n\r\n145\r\n00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,730\r\nIt's a logical answer, but\r\nit's absolutely true.\r\n\r\n146\r\n00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,530\r\nAnd do you miss it, Claudio?\r\n\r\n147\r\n00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:01,620\r\nSorry?\r\n\r\n148\r\n00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,320\r\nDo you miss the orchestra?\r\n\r\n149\r\n00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,510\r\nNo, I don't miss it.\r\n\r\n150\r\n00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,410\r\nI come every year.\r\n\r\n151\r\n00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:05,890\r\nYou come every year.\r\n\r\n152\r\n00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,460\r\nWe don't give you a\r\nchance to miss us.\r\n\r\n153\r\n00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,550\r\nNo, but you know how it is.\r\n\r\n154\r\n00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,235\r\nI play just one concert in\r\nBerlin, two concerts in\r\n\r\n155\r\n00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:13,725\r\nLucerne, and something with\r\na Mozart Orchestra.\r\n\r\n156\r\n00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:14,780\r\nThat's it.\r\n\r\n157\r\n00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,600\r\nBut you're feeling fine?\r\n\r\n158\r\n00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,190\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n159\r\n00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:16,845\r\nGreat.\r\n\r\n160\r\n00:06:16,845 --> 00:06:20,090\r\nBut I take more time\r\nfor myself to\r\n\r\n161\r\n00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,570\r\nstudy, to read, to learn.\r\n\r\n162\r\n00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,200\r\nAll life, we have to\r\nlearn something.\r\n\r\n163\r\n00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,970\r\nIt's important.\r\n\r\n164\r\n00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,130\r\nAnna, you're still so young and\r\nvivacious, you don't need\r\n\r\n165\r\n00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,600\r\nto take so much time for\r\nyourself, or do you?\r\n\r\n166\r\n00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,120\r\nWhat you do when you're not\r\npreparing, because you're\r\n\r\n167\r\n00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,590\r\nquite busy these days?\r\n\r\n168\r\n00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,230\r\nDefinitely.\r\n\r\n169\r\n00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,620\r\nSometimes maybe once a year, I\r\nhave a three week holiday, and\r\n\r\n170\r\n00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,480\r\notherwise I'm usually\r\nworking through.\r\n\r\n171\r\n00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,790\r\nIf I have three, four five days\r\nsometime, I love to just\r\n\r\n172\r\n00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,980\r\ngo off, take a plane to some new\r\ncity that I haven't seen.\r\n\r\n173\r\n00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,790\r\nI'm not so much of\r\na beach person.\r\n\r\n174\r\n00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,880\r\nI love to go to a new place to\r\nsee, for example, historical\r\n\r\n175\r\n00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,930\r\nexcavations, wonderful\r\nmuseums.\r\n\r\n176\r\n00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,620\r\nThose are the things that I do\r\nfirst in a new town, and then\r\n\r\n177\r\n00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,160\r\nI like to hear the local\r\norchestra, see\r\n\r\n178\r\n00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,800\r\nmaybe a play in a theater.\r\n\r\n179\r\n00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,740\r\nI'm a great fan of straight\r\ntheater as well, so not just\r\n\r\n180\r\n00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,040\r\nmusic, but also theater\r\nin the wider sense.\r\n\r\n181\r\n00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,030\r\nI'm a huge history fan.\r\n\r\n182\r\n00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,490\r\nI love to read about the\r\nRoman Empire up to the\r\n\r\n183\r\n00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,780\r\nSecond World War.\r\n\r\n184\r\n00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,090\r\nThat's one of the most\r\ninteresting things for me.\r\n\r\n185\r\n00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,995\r\nAnd I love hiking, so I'm\r\nfrom the mountains.\r\n\r\n186\r\n00:07:24,995 --> 00:07:26,630\r\nWell, you'll have to\r\ngo together, then.\r\n\r\n187\r\n00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,070\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n188\r\n00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,160\r\nYeah, why not?\r\n\r\n189\r\n00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,840\r\nWe went on a little hike in\r\nVenezuela in the botanical\r\n\r\n190\r\n00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,080\r\ngardens that have quite a\r\nlot of hills and stuff,\r\n\r\n191\r\n00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,490\r\nand it was very hot.\r\n\r\n192\r\n00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,370\r\nI remember that.\r\n\r\n193\r\n00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,578\r\nIt was very humid and hot.\r\n\r\n194\r\n00:07:40,578 --> 00:07:41,522\r\nI forgot.\r\n\r\n195\r\n00:07:41,522 --> 00:07:44,010\r\nAnna, I know, she's very sporty,\r\nand when she goes\r\n\r\n196\r\n00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:48,000\r\njogging, she likes to listen to\r\nheavy metal, so it's quite\r\n\r\n197\r\n00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,750\r\nincredible, heavy metal music.\r\n\r\n198\r\n00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,370\r\nSo this incredibly ethereal\r\nvoice, and while she's\r\n\r\n199\r\n00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,090\r\njogging, she hears\r\nheavy metal.\r\n\r\n200\r\n00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,640\r\nDo you have any secret\r\nmusic loves as well?\r\n\r\n201\r\n00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,350\r\nWhen I was sick, I heard Bach.\r\n\r\n202\r\n00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,840\r\nIt was a great medicine.\r\n\r\n203\r\n00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,782\r\nMedicine, yeah.\r\n\r\n204\r\n00:08:04,782 --> 00:08:06,670\r\nBach is good medicine.\r\n\r\n205\r\n00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,490\r\nMedicine for the soul,\r\nisn't it, music?\r\n\r\n206\r\n00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,490\r\nAre you a jazz fan, or\r\ndo you like other\r\n\r\n207\r\n00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,220\r\ntypes of music as well?\r\n\r\n208\r\n00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,730\r\nI was a jazz fan when\r\nI was very, very\r\n\r\n209\r\n00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,570\r\nyoung, 16 years old.\r\n\r\n210\r\n00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:23,230\r\nBut after this period, not\r\nso much, absolutely.\r\n\r\n211\r\n00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,530\r\nYou're for Mozart.\r\n\r\n212\r\n00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,830\r\nYes, you can hear it.\r\n\r\n213\r\n00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,650\r\nIt's really so wonderful\r\nto hear you\r\n\r\n214\r\n00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,080\r\nplaying Mozart this week.\r\n\r\n215\r\n00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,600\r\nThe program, Claudio.\r\n\r\n216\r\n00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,780\r\nTell me, you've balanced Mozart\r\nand then Berg, and then\r\n\r\n217\r\n00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,470\r\nMozart and then Mahler.\r\n\r\n218\r\n00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,929\r\nAnd the Mahler 10, I couldn't\r\nfind any information that\r\n\r\n219\r\n00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:43,510\r\nyou've done this before in the\r\norchestra because you did a\r\n\r\n220\r\n00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,010\r\nlot of Mahler with the\r\nPhilharmonic because they\r\n\r\n221\r\n00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,430\r\ndidn't play so much\r\nMahler, did they?\r\n\r\n222\r\n00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,860\r\nWe played all the symphonies,\r\nI think.\r\n\r\n223\r\n00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,970\r\nAll of them.\r\n\r\n224\r\n00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,310\r\nExcept the 8, that\r\nwe didn't play.\r\n\r\n225\r\n00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,060\r\nYou--\r\n\r\n226\r\n00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,320\r\nI recorded.\r\n\r\n227\r\n00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,340\r\nYou did the 8.\r\n\r\n228\r\n00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,180\r\nI remember.\r\n\r\n229\r\n00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:00,765\r\nYou were here--\r\n\r\n230\r\n00:09:00,765 --> 00:09:01,450\r\nIn Berlin?\r\n\r\n231\r\n00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,302\r\nIn Berlin.\r\n\r\n232\r\n00:09:02,302 --> 00:09:04,024\r\nThen he's right.\r\n\r\n233\r\n00:09:04,024 --> 00:09:04,516\r\nYes?\r\n\r\n234\r\n00:09:04,516 --> 00:09:07,470\r\nSee, friends know you best.\r\n\r\n235\r\n00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,540\r\nThis aria that Anna's singing,\r\nyesterday in the rehearsal, we\r\n\r\n236\r\n00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,550\r\nwere all just smiling during\r\nit because it's incredibly\r\n\r\n237\r\n00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,055\r\ndifficult, incredibly\r\nvirtuosic,\r\n\r\n238\r\n00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,800\r\nand absolutely gorgeous.\r\n\r\n239\r\n00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,200\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n240\r\n00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,690\r\nShe's doing wonderful.\r\n\r\n241\r\n00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,410\r\nIs it particularly difficult\r\nto sing?\r\n\r\n242\r\n00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,280\r\nWell, yes.\r\n\r\n243\r\n00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,460\r\nI mean, you've got to really\r\nhold yourself back and\r\n\r\n244\r\n00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,400\r\nconstantly, you think about\r\ntechnique, although I'm more\r\n\r\n245\r\n00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,490\r\nof an emotional person.\r\n\r\n246\r\n00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:34,450\r\nI'm someone who accesses music\r\nthrough emotions, and also\r\n\r\n247\r\n00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,890\r\nthrough the brain, thinking\r\nabout the text, of course, but\r\n\r\n248\r\n00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,550\r\nespecially through feeling\r\nthe music.\r\n\r\n249\r\n00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,630\r\nAnd if you let your body go wild\r\nduring the piece, then\r\n\r\n250\r\n00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:48,490\r\nyou lose this amazing, pristine,\r\ncrystalline line\r\n\r\n251\r\n00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,640\r\nwhich you have to have for this\r\nvery slow and very high\r\n\r\n252\r\n00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,660\r\nand languid sounding Mozart.\r\n\r\n253\r\n00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,110\r\nSo it's a bit of a challenge,\r\nbut with this amazing\r\n\r\n254\r\n00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,940\r\naccompaniment, it's not\r\nas difficult as I\r\n\r\n255\r\n00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,912\r\nthought it would be.\r\n\r\n256\r\n00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:07,775\r\nIt was wonderful to hear the\r\nvoice, and then with the oboe,\r\n\r\n257\r\n00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:08,510\r\n[INAUDIBLE].\r\n\r\n258\r\n00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,090\r\nThat was a fantastic duet.\r\n\r\n259\r\n00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:10,775\r\nIt is.\r\n\r\n260\r\n00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:12,180\r\nIt's like two voices together.\r\n\r\n261\r\n00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,750\r\nIt's wonderful.\r\n\r\n262\r\n00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,500\r\nThat's what I love about also\r\nbeing in a duet with an oboe\r\n\r\n263\r\n00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,620\r\nbecause it's maybe the\r\ninstrument that's closest to\r\n\r\n264\r\n00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,270\r\nthe soprano voice.\r\n\r\n265\r\n00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:25,530\r\nIt's practically the same\r\ntessitura, and it's also got a\r\n\r\n266\r\n00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,550\r\nsimilar sound with the vibrato,\r\nthe non-vibrato,\r\n\r\n267\r\n00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,810\r\nthese things that they\r\ncan also play with.\r\n\r\n268\r\n00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,980\r\nAnd also, I have a kind of\r\ndouble reed in my throat,\r\n\r\n269\r\n00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,580\r\nhaven't I, like a double\r\nreed instrument?\r\n\r\n270\r\n00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,020\r\nA double reed in your throat.\r\n\r\n271\r\n00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,960\r\nPhysically, it's a\r\nsimilar thing.\r\n\r\n272\r\n00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,060\r\nIt's really true.\r\n\r\n273\r\n00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,950\r\nIs it particularly nerve\r\nwracking as a young singer to\r\n\r\n274\r\n00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,250\r\nget up on stage and\r\n[INAUDIBLE]?\r\n\r\n275\r\n00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,705\r\nShe has to start with Mozart.\r\n\r\n276\r\n00:10:48,705 --> 00:10:51,140\r\nYeah, to also start\r\nwith Mozart.\r\n\r\n277\r\n00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,160\r\nIt's quite a scary piece\r\nto start with.\r\n\r\n278\r\n00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,410\r\nThat's true.\r\n\r\n279\r\n00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,080\r\nIt's a great piece.\r\n\r\n280\r\n00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,650\r\nBut it's better.\r\n\r\n281\r\n00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,670\r\nAlso, we start the\r\nrehearsals too.\r\n\r\n282\r\n00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,800\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n283\r\n00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,280\r\nI find it better that way\r\nbecause throughout the\r\n\r\n284\r\n00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,040\r\nevening, I can get more\r\nand more dramatic.\r\n\r\n285\r\n00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,480\r\nSo the first half of the aria is\r\nvery crystalline, and then\r\n\r\n286\r\n00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,170\r\nit goes into more of a\r\nspinto, more dramatic\r\n\r\n287\r\n00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,180\r\ncoloring in the Mozart.\r\n\r\n288\r\n00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,770\r\nAnd then the next piece in the\r\nBerg, which lets me really let\r\n\r\n289\r\n00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:24,830\r\nrip, and I can really have fun\r\nwith the high notes and the\r\n\r\n290\r\n00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,740\r\ncoloratura.\r\n\r\n291\r\n00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,500\r\nBut it's a lot more dramatic.\r\n\r\n292\r\n00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,100\r\nSo technically, for the voice,\r\nit's better that way to do\r\n\r\n293\r\n00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,540\r\nMozart first, and then a\r\nromantic piece-- which I think\r\n\r\n294\r\n00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,370\r\nLulu still is.\r\n\r\n295\r\n00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,890\r\nIt's very late romantic.\r\n\r\n296\r\n00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,780\r\nI've imagined with soloists,\r\nwhen I've done horn concertos,\r\n\r\n297\r\n00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,060\r\nthe waiting is the worst part,\r\nthe traditional waiting until\r\n\r\n298\r\n00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,020\r\nthe overture is finished and\r\nsitting in your dressing room\r\n\r\n299\r\n00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,170\r\nall by yourself.\r\n\r\n300\r\n00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,022\r\nIs that the worst part\r\nfor you, the waiting?\r\n\r\n301\r\n00:11:52,022 --> 00:11:53,760\r\nIt depends from the night.\r\n\r\n302\r\n00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,150\r\nFrom the night, yeah.\r\n\r\n303\r\n00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,230\r\nIt's always a matter\r\nof how you feel.\r\n\r\n304\r\n00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,630\r\nThis getting nervous thing\r\nis never something\r\n\r\n305\r\n00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,030\r\nI've managed to--\r\n\r\n306\r\n00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,710\r\nAnd it doesn't get\r\nless and less.\r\n\r\n307\r\n00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,290\r\nI mean, you can--\r\n\r\n308\r\n00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:03,610\r\nI don't know.\r\n\r\n309\r\n00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,590\r\nDoes it get less?\r\n\r\n310\r\n00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,080\r\nDoes getting nervous get less?\r\n\r\n311\r\n00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,540\r\nI have the impression\r\nthat it stays.\r\n\r\n312\r\n00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,010\r\nIt stays.\r\n\r\n313\r\n00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:08,930\r\nOh no.\r\n\r\n314\r\n00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,090\r\nWe want it to go away.\r\n\r\n315\r\n00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:16,350\r\nTo be honest, singing my first\r\nsolo in [INAUDIBLE], or Haydn\r\n\r\n316\r\n00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,530\r\nMass or something in church or\r\nat school was actually just as\r\n\r\n317\r\n00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,540\r\nnerve wracking as performing\r\nnowadays.\r\n\r\n318\r\n00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,850\r\nIt's just that nowadays, you\r\nalso know the consequences.\r\n\r\n319\r\n00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:31,570\r\nYou know the prospects, what\r\nmight happen, and you have\r\n\r\n320\r\n00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,920\r\nmuch more of an idea of\r\nthe music industry and\r\n\r\n321\r\n00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,720\r\nthese kind of things.\r\n\r\n322\r\n00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,330\r\nAlso modern music industry with\r\nall these electronic new\r\n\r\n323\r\n00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:44,140\r\nintroductions, like YouTube and\r\nthese things where we're\r\n\r\n324\r\n00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,350\r\nconstantly under surveillance\r\nby the public.\r\n\r\n325\r\n00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,410\r\nIt's a lot more, I think,\r\nthan it was earlier.\r\n\r\n326\r\n00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,620\r\nNow everybody can come with a\r\nlittle camera, can record any\r\n\r\n327\r\n00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,150\r\nrehearsal or any concert, and\r\nthen it's on the internet.\r\n\r\n328\r\n00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,600\r\nWhat do you think of this?\r\n\r\n329\r\n00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,970\r\nDo you agree with Anna?\r\n\r\n330\r\n00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,360\r\nEverything is so recorded these\r\ndays, every little cough\r\n\r\n331\r\n00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,070\r\non stage, somebody's out\r\nthere recording it.\r\n\r\n332\r\n00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:11,640\r\nIn the future, there will be\r\nwitness of all musicians and\r\n\r\n333\r\n00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,590\r\nnothing will escape, but it\r\nwill be a great help also.\r\n\r\n334\r\n00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:20,120\r\nIf we could know something\r\nabout Beethoven or Chopin\r\n\r\n335\r\n00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,780\r\nplaying, it would be a great\r\nadvantage for us, but we\r\n\r\n336\r\n00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,995\r\ncannot have that.\r\n\r\n337\r\n00:13:25,995 --> 00:13:26,400\r\nAbsolutely.\r\n\r\n338\r\n00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,260\r\nMy brother's a conductor.\r\n\r\n339\r\n00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,960\r\nBut we have Stravinsky\r\nconducting, and Schoenberg\r\n\r\n340\r\n00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:34,520\r\nconducting, and other great\r\nconductors, et cetera.\r\n\r\n341\r\n00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,460\r\nYou do this wonderful Progetto\r\nPollini, this wonderful\r\n\r\n342\r\n00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,600\r\nmixture of old and new.\r\n\r\n343\r\n00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,655\r\nYou did Monteverdi was mixed\r\nwith Rihm and Boulez.\r\n\r\n344\r\n00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:51,040\r\nI took care of some cycle of\r\nconcerts here, and they are\r\n\r\n345\r\n00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,340\r\nalso presenting some works that\r\nare not played every day.\r\n\r\n346\r\n00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:59,180\r\nAnd so also ancient work, as\r\nwell as some contemporary or\r\n\r\n347\r\n00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:07,910\r\nmodern works that are not, in\r\nmy opinion, played enough in\r\n\r\n348\r\n00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:15,210\r\nthe concert scene, which is\r\nrepresented mostly by the 19th\r\n\r\n349\r\n00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,280\r\nand 18th century.\r\n\r\n350\r\n00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,580\r\nNono was a great friend\r\nof yours, wasn't he?\r\n\r\n351\r\n00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,100\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n352\r\n00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,760\r\nI was reading about\r\nthe film that you\r\n\r\n353\r\n00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,960\r\nmade with him together.\r\n\r\n354\r\n00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,750\r\nWe played many--\r\n\r\n355\r\n00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,475\r\nMany things.\r\n\r\n356\r\n00:14:25,475 --> 00:14:28,120\r\nMany things for the\r\nfirst time.\r\n\r\n357\r\n00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,390\r\nAnna sang an opera by Nono.\r\n\r\n358\r\n00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,760\r\nAl Gran Sole Carico D'Amore two\r\nyears ago at the Salzburg\r\n\r\n359\r\n00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,780\r\nFestival, and I was so excited\r\nto hear that Claudio did the\r\n\r\n360\r\n00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,490\r\nworld premiere at La\r\nScala back then.\r\n\r\n361\r\n00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,515\r\nAnd a very turbulent time,\r\nwasn't it, 1968 or around\r\n\r\n362\r\n00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:45,180\r\nthen? '68, '69?\r\n\r\n363\r\n00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,130\r\nYes, it was like a revolution.\r\n\r\n364\r\n00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,145\r\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\r\n\r\n365\r\n00:14:48,145 --> 00:14:49,235\r\nWith the audience of\r\nLa Scala, you know?\r\n\r\n366\r\n00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:50,710\r\nI can imagine.\r\n\r\n367\r\n00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,840\r\nHow did they react to that?\r\n\r\n368\r\n00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,670\r\nSomebody likes it, somebody\r\ndidn't like.\r\n\r\n369\r\n00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,760\r\nBut usually the ones who\r\ndon't like it are the\r\n\r\n370\r\n00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,650\r\nlouder ones, right?\r\n\r\n371\r\n00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,350\r\nIn La Scala, I think so, yeah.\r\n\r\n372\r\n00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,190\r\nNot so much.\r\n\r\n373\r\n00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,090\r\nNo?\r\n\r\n374\r\n00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,570\r\nNo, not so much.\r\n\r\n375\r\n00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,860\r\nBut you know, it takes time.\r\n\r\n376\r\n00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,050\r\nLike today we were just\r\ntalking about Mahler.\r\n\r\n377\r\n00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:14,140\r\nWhen they played for the first\r\ntime Mahler 10, the adagio,\r\n\r\n378\r\n00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,210\r\nthey didn't understand\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n379\r\n00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,590\r\nIt takes time.\r\n\r\n380\r\n00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,620\r\nMahler, [INAUDIBLE]\r\n\r\n381\r\n00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,720\r\nwe need a half century to\r\nunderstand his music.\r\n\r\n382\r\n00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,440\r\nAnd with Nono, it's the same.\r\n\r\n383\r\n00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,740\r\nDo you think there's a\r\nsimilarity between Mahler's\r\n\r\n384\r\n00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,760\r\n10th Adagio and the Lulu Adagio,\r\nbecause listening to\r\n\r\n385\r\n00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,950\r\nboth of them yesterday in the\r\nrehearsal, there's very, very\r\n\r\n386\r\n00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,625\r\nsimilar parts in there.\r\n\r\n387\r\n00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,310\r\nYou know, studying these two\r\nscores, I was thinking, you\r\n\r\n388\r\n00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,120\r\nknow, Mahler was even more\r\nmodern than Berg.\r\n\r\n389\r\n00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,660\r\nHe was.\r\n\r\n390\r\n00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,800\r\nWith the harmony.\r\n\r\n391\r\n00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,650\r\nThere's something incredible.\r\n\r\n392\r\n00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:51,090\r\nOf course, Berg is a wonderful\r\ncomposer, so new\r\n\r\n393\r\n00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,210\r\nfor his time, no?\r\n\r\n394\r\n00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,820\r\nBut Mahler was at the beginning\r\nof the 19th century,\r\n\r\n395\r\n00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,704\r\nso that's incredible.\r\n\r\n396\r\n00:15:58,704 --> 00:16:00,120\r\nSo how about a Lulu with Anna?\r\n\r\n397\r\n00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,380\r\nI can imagine you as\r\nthe perfect Lulu.\r\n\r\n398\r\n00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,360\r\nOh, thank you.\r\n\r\n399\r\n00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,196\r\nI could.\r\n\r\n400\r\n00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:04,890\r\nDon't you think?\r\n\r\n401\r\n00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:05,740\r\nYes, sure.\r\n\r\n402\r\n00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,530\r\nSo there we go.\r\n\r\n403\r\n00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:06,910\r\nThat's a collaboration.\r\n\r\n404\r\n00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,590\r\nIt was a project.\r\n\r\n405\r\n00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,480\r\nYou are doing it, I hope?\r\n\r\n406\r\n00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,910\r\nYeah, but I think in\r\na few years time.\r\n\r\n407\r\n00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,730\r\nNot yet.\r\n\r\n408\r\n00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,130\r\nAs we all know, the orchestra\r\nis just so huge, and the\r\n\r\n409\r\n00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:21,220\r\ntessitura is actually for a\r\ncoloratura soprano, and you\r\n\r\n410\r\n00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,220\r\nneed a lot of middle, though.\r\n\r\n411\r\n00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,330\r\nYou need three voices.\r\n\r\n412\r\n00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,620\r\nIt's like Traviata, these\r\nbig, big soprano\r\n\r\n413\r\n00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,560\r\nroles that you have.\r\n\r\n414\r\n00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,320\r\nYeah, very dramatic.\r\n\r\n415\r\n00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,040\r\nExactly, but also high.\r\n\r\n416\r\n00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,590\r\nSo I think I'll wait a\r\nfew years and then\r\n\r\n417\r\n00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,680\r\nI'll be very happy.\r\n\r\n418\r\n00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,000\r\nIt's my absolute dream role.\r\n\r\n419\r\n00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,762\r\nThat's wise.\r\n\r\n420\r\n00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,570\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n421\r\n00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:43,390\r\nClaudio, we're up here in the\r\norchestra recreation room, and\r\n\r\n422\r\n00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,170\r\nthere's a poster here\r\non the wall--\r\n\r\n423\r\n00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,613\r\nI don't know if you've\r\nseen it-- from 1956,\r\n\r\n424\r\n00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:48,650\r\nif I may say that.\r\n\r\n425\r\n00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:53,470\r\nAnd it was a competition of\r\nCarlo \"Secchi,\" it says?\r\n\r\n426\r\n00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,260\r\nZecchi.\r\n\r\n427\r\n00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,610\r\nZecchi.\r\n\r\n428\r\n00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,750\r\nAnd you were taking\r\npart with Zubin\r\n\r\n429\r\n00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,440\r\nMehtca and Daniel Baremboim.\r\n\r\n430\r\n00:16:59,440 --> 00:16:59,860\r\nYeah, in Sienna.\r\n\r\n431\r\n00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,370\r\nDo you remember this?\r\n\r\n432\r\n00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:00,950\r\nIn Sienna.\r\n\r\n433\r\n00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,630\r\nIt's on the poster.\r\n\r\n434\r\n00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,350\r\nYes, I remember this.\r\n\r\n435\r\n00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,869\r\nAnd this is the original\r\nposter from there.\r\n\r\n436\r\n00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:07,829\r\nI didn't see the poster, but\r\nI remember in Sienna.\r\n\r\n437\r\n00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,040\r\nYes, we're very privileged\r\nto have this poster here.\r\n\r\n438\r\n00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,240\r\nAnd Zecchi was a\r\ngreat pianist.\r\n\r\n439\r\n00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,270\r\nThen he decided to conduct,\r\nand was teaching.\r\n\r\n440\r\n00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,859\r\nIt was very interesting.\r\n\r\n441\r\n00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,550\r\nAnd who won?\r\n\r\n442\r\n00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,109\r\nWho won?\r\n\r\n443\r\n00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:20,690\r\nWho won the competition?\r\n\r\n444\r\n00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,079\r\nWas it a competition?\r\n\r\n445\r\n00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,025\r\nIt was not a competition.\r\n\r\n446\r\n00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:24,700\r\nOh, it was just a concert of\r\nall the up and coming young\r\n\r\n447\r\n00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,020\r\nconductors.\r\n\r\n448\r\n00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,130\r\nNo, I think they invited\r\nonly a few conductors\r\n\r\n449\r\n00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,450\r\nto study with Zecchi.\r\n\r\n450\r\n00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,110\r\nWe never knew this.\r\n\r\n451\r\n00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,540\r\nIt was not a competition.\r\n\r\n452\r\n00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,590\r\nWe though it was some sort\r\nof a competition.\r\n\r\n453\r\n00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,380\r\nIt was a good friendship.\r\n\r\n454\r\n00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,570\r\nYeah, a good friendship.\r\n\r\n455\r\n00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,230\r\nA good friendship like\r\nall three of you,
