The works of Boulez\r\nare as unknown as the poetry of Mallarm\u00e9.\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:02:01,683 --> 00:02:04,383\r\nThe poet whose works he preferred to\r\ncompose music to.\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:02:04,493 --> 00:02:07,993\r\nWith Berio it is the full\r\ngrasp into the reality of life.\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:14,670\r\nBerio pulled his music out of the landscape\r\nand village cultures\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:18,699\r\nand town cultures as well as\r\ntheir poetry.\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:26,014\r\nThere are often moments in his music that\r\nreflect street demonstrations and the like.\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,470\r\nThe contemporaneous link to our world\r\nand its present conditions\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:02:30,597 --> 00:02:37,497\r\nis always evident in the work of Berio.\r\nAnd so the two composers differ fundamentally.\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:02:37,568 --> 00:02:42,668\r\nI believe that Berio has a process\r\nof working in stages\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:48,644\r\non the one hand the found materials\r\nthrough sound recordings\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:52,318\r\nand then there are the folk songs\r\nwith materials he found.\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:02:52,417 --> 00:03:00,117\r\nPerhaps you could comment on that. There is\r\nin part, a scientific linguistic theory behind it.\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:03:00,184 --> 00:03:05,184\r\nThe linguistic theory is somewhat complicated.\r\nIt refers back to Roman Jacobson\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:03:05,282 --> 00:03:08,682\r\nand the two knew each other well and\r\nworked together.\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:03:08,758 --> 00:03:16,958\r\nI kept it a little simpler for the Musikfest since\r\nI want the audience to have easy access to the work.\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,041\r\nWe are not a listening room but\r\na concert hall!\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:03:19,095 --> 00:03:23,795\r\nI tried to bring together the works\r\nof Berio\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:30,566\r\nthat have something in common as far as\r\ntheir sound and how they came about.\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:37,217\r\nAnd I put together a series of works here\r\nthat I titled Folk Songs.\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:03:37,268 --> 00:03:42,468\r\nFolk Songs is actually a title of a piece\r\nby Berio.\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:49,430\r\nIn the piece he instrumentalised folk songs\r\nfrom other cultures\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:03:49,537 --> 00:03:59,237\r\nleaving the melodies and lyrics as they were but\r\nadding orchestral instruments that we know.\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,300\r\nHe gave them a unique new\r\ncloak or clothing.\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:09,505\r\nAnd there are other processes \r\nwhere Berio took\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:04:09,555 --> 00:04:15,419\r\nthe melodies and transformed \r\nthem with intrumentation.\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:04:15,473 --> 00:04:21,173\r\nEspecially in the Concerto for Viola and\r\nOrchestra called \u201cVoci\u201d.\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:24,881\r\nAnd it is a very interesting\r\ntransformation process\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:28,701\r\nbecause when you contemplate language you\r\nhave to consider vowels and consonants.\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:04:28,843 --> 00:04:34,637\r\nAnd when you try to transform \r\nthe songs into an instrumental form\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:41,143\r\nyou must consider how to get the vowel and\r\nconsonant sounds into the instrument sounds.\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:44,367\r\nThat happens in \u201cVoci\u201d. There is\r\na large part where there are noises\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,720\r\nand there are very strong sung passages\r\nand a lot of percussion\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,830\r\nand all those things in the piece.\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:57,134\r\nA completely different process takes\r\nplace in \u201cCoro\u201d that we heard this evening\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:05,799\r\nwhere Luciano Berio collected songs\r\nfrom a wide variety of different cultures\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:11,132\r\nand there are passages that\r\nsound very folkloric.\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:05:11,262 --> 00:05:14,562\r\nBut they are all melodies which\r\nwere composed by Berio himself.\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:19,899\r\nWhich is to say that Berio is so immersed\r\nin the idiom of the different cultures\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:05:19,977 --> 00:05:23,677\r\nthat he can allow himself to say\r\nI will just do it myself.\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:05:23,731 --> 00:05:28,731\r\nYou could almost compare it with Brahms where\r\nthe Hungarian Dances contain no Hungarian melodies\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:05:28,774 --> 00:05:35,074\r\nbut rather were composed by Brahms reflecting\r\nwhat he had heard as a Hungarian idiom.\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:05:35,163 --> 00:05:42,763\r\nIn principle, yes. It shows a similar virtuosity\r\nand knowledge of the material.\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:05:42,854 --> 00:05:46,854\r\nIn another case of Berio\u2019s work we will\r\nhear on Monday in a concert.\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:05:46,962 --> 00:05:54,562\r\nThe piece is called \u201cNaturale\u201d and it is a\r\nfolk song melody which one hears in the viola\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:02,020\r\nbut he also took the recorded songs of a \r\nSicilian singer which he has on tape.\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:08,659\r\nIt is a kind of photography as in a photo album\r\nwhich is here in a musical form.\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:06:08,716 --> 00:06:14,416\r\nIn principle you have the entire palette\r\nof possibilities for musical integration\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:17,909\r\nwithin the works of Berio and all\r\nits possibilities in this programme.\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:06:18,013 --> 00:06:26,613\r\nPerhaps we can look at \u201cCoro\u201d. Music was\r\nlike an ocean world for Berio the traveller\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:33,009\r\nthere is the metaphor that Berio would have\r\nliked to be a captain and sailed the seas.\r\n\r\n70\r\n00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:35,474\r\nHe did that, at least mentally.\r\n\r\n71\r\n00:06:35,554 --> 00:06:42,554\r\n\u201cCoro\u201d is I think, a collage of texts\r\nfrom differing cultures\r\n\r\n72\r\n00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:51,035\r\nthat are on the one hand bracketed\r\nby the verse of the poet Pablo Neruda.\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:58,542\r\nThe question is what is the function of this\r\nbracketing? What is behind it?\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:06:58,678 --> 00:07:04,630\r\nFirst it is important to say that Berio\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,478\r\ndedicated \u201cCoro\u201d to his wife Talia Berio.\r\n\r\n76\r\n00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:14,611\r\nI hear it as a great canticle\r\nor song of songs.\r\n\r\n77\r\n00:07:14,695 --> 00:07:18,895\r\nIt is a cycle of songs. - The canticle\r\nis also in the work. - Yes it\u2019s there.\r\n\r\n78\r\n00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:21,966\r\nNot all of it but only\r\na small part.\r\n\r\n79\r\n00:07:22,072 --> 00:07:25,572\r\nAnd one finds that many of the passages,\r\nat least as I read the texts,\r\n\r\n80\r\n00:07:25,716 --> 00:07:30,416\r\nare replaced with texts that he\r\nfound in native Indian cultures.\r\n\r\n81\r\n00:07:30,554 --> 00:07:39,554\r\nSo it is a similar text with a similar function\r\nbut with other applications added onto it. \r\n\r\n82\r\n00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:46,639\r\nThe texts deal with love and work and then\r\nsomething typically Berio is added\r\n\r\n83\r\n00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:54,960\r\nwhereby intimate togetherness is set\r\nagainst a larger social context.\r\n\r\n84\r\n00:07:55,068 --> 00:08:01,568\r\nAnd the social context in 1975 and 1976\r\nwhen the piece was created\r\n\r\n85\r\n00:08:01,704 --> 00:08:08,604\r\nwas of course the putsch in Chile.\r\n- Allende. - 1973.\r\n\r\n86\r\n00:08:08,704 --> 00:08:14,704\r\nAnd that is why the text by\r\nPablo Neruda is included.\r\n\r\n87\r\n00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:20,339\r\nWhen you listen to the piece you hear the movement\r\nfrom individual soloists to\r\n\r\n88\r\n00:08:20,394 --> 00:08:23,894\r\nthe larger massed group. And Berio\r\ndoes something very interesting\r\n\r\n89\r\n00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:30,900\r\nat least from a sociological point of\r\nview. The individual person and the crowd\r\n\r\n90\r\n00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:36,561\r\nseen sociologically are extreme\r\nconditions that are anything but desirable.\r\n\r\n91\r\n00:08:36,697 --> 00:08:41,397\r\nAnd Berio structured this orchestral piece\r\n\r\n92\r\n00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:47,600\r\nas if the orchestra was moving back and\r\nforth between these two extreme positions.\r\n\r\n93\r\n00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:54,544\r\nHe used the device of always bracketing\r\none instrumentalist and one vocalist.\r\n\r\n94\r\n00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:56,551\r\nIt is almost the intimate togetherness\r\nwe spoke of earlier. - Precisely.\r\n\r\n95\r\n00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,560\r\nThe instrumentalist and the vocalist\r\nare like man and wife.\r\n\r\n96\r\n00:09:01,656 --> 00:09:05,356\r\nAnd the whole piece is built\r\nup with this principle in mind.\r\n\r\n97\r\n00:09:05,442 --> 00:09:10,442\r\nSmall living groups that get larger and then\r\nbecome smaller again. - Group dynamics.\r\n\r\n98\r\n00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:19,582\r\nPrecisely. And this shows the way the trivia\r\nof day to day life take on larger meaning\r\n\r\n99\r\n00:09:19,668 --> 00:09:24,668\r\nand that is the dynamic of the piece.\r\nIt is a great declaration of love.\r\n\r\n100\r\n00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:32,219\r\nAnd at the same time it is a more dramatic\r\nand tragic societal condition.\r\n\r\n101\r\n00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:34,337\r\nWhich is what we experience\r\non a daily basis.\r\n\r\n102\r\n00:09:34,422 --> 00:09:41,622\r\nIt is yet another example of how much Berio\u2019s\r\nmusic blends with real life.\r\n\r\n103\r\n00:09:41,678 --> 00:09:44,878\r\nAnd at the same time can be best understood\r\nin the context of real life.\r\n\r\n104\r\n00:09:46,838 --> 00:09:55,738\r\nAnd then it is just a step, after a short pause\r\nto Stravinsky, the second composer of the evening.\r\n\r\n105\r\n00:09:55,815 --> 00:09:58,215\r\nHe was important to both\r\nBoulez and Berio.\r\n\r\n106\r\n00:09:58,325 --> 00:10:03,625\r\nHis work inspired both composers\r\nin their younger years.\r\n\r\n107\r\n00:10:03,717 --> 00:10:08,817\r\nAnd in \u201cPulcinella\u201d, which was\r\nhis first neo-classical composition\r\n\r\n108\r\n00:10:08,952 --> 00:10:12,252\r\nhe does something that we also\r\nfind with Berio.\r\n\r\n109\r\n00:10:12,384 --> 00:10:19,384\r\nHe transcribes chamber music from Giovanni\r\nBattista Pergolesi, Domenico Galli \r\n\r\n110\r\n00:10:19,516 --> 00:10:26,216\r\nand other 17th century composers. But he doesn\u2019t\r\nsimply transcribe it, he composes it anew.\r\n\r\n111\r\n00:10:26,276 --> 00:10:32,576\r\nWas that the idea behind \u201cPulcinella\u201d,\r\n\r\n112\r\n00:10:32,702 --> 00:10:38,702\r\nwhich plays in another century completely and\r\nwe must mention in Commedia dell'arte style?\r\n\r\n113\r\n00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:44,867\r\nOn the one hand it is music being played\r\nand it is a play on music by Stravinsky\r\n\r\n114\r\n00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:50,229\r\nand it is a play on confusion of characters\r\nin the style of Commedia dell'arte\r\n\r\n115\r\n00:10:50,361 --> 00:10:54,261\r\nbetween \u201cPulcinella\u201d the awkward\r\nbut very instinctive servant\r\n\r\n116\r\n00:10:54,315 --> 00:11:00,315\r\nwho is, though for us it is hard to understand,\r\nfavoured by pretty young women\r\n\r\n117\r\n00:11:00,614 --> 00:11:05,414\r\nand he is pressured by jealous competitors\r\nwho want to kill him. But there is a happy end.\r\n\r\n118\r\n00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:10,198\r\nEveryone gets the girl he wanted. It is a\r\ngame of confusion on many different levels.\r\n\r\n119\r\n00:11:10,293 --> 00:11:17,193\r\nAnd the playful element is perhaps\r\nnot completely typical for Stravinsky.\r\n\r\n120\r\n00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:23,228\r\nIn the way he deals with other materials\r\nthat aren\u2019t originally his it is typical.\r\n\r\n121\r\n00:11:23,318 --> 00:11:29,718\r\nAnd it is, I think, the ingredient\r\nthat links him with Berio.\r\n\r\n122\r\n00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:33,363\r\nAnd I think also with Boulez only\r\nthe interesting thing with Boulez\r\n\r\n123\r\n00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:40,432\r\nis that the materials he uses from others\r\nhe makes so totally over into his own\r\n\r\n124\r\n00:11:40,528 --> 00:11:45,528\r\nthat in the end you can\u2019t really make out\r\nwhere they come from.\r\n\r\n125\r\n00:11:45,596 --> 00:11:51,196\r\nHe is a great almost\r\nalchemical change artist.\r\n\r\n126\r\n00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:55,659\r\nWhereas with Berio and Stravinsky the two\r\nthings are very tightly woven.\r\n\r\n127\r\n00:11:55,761 --> 00:11:59,961\r\nWhat is one\u2019s own and what is\r\nfrom someone else remain intact.\r\n\r\n128\r\n00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:04,996\r\nBut you are right. With Stravinsky the\r\noriginal is most important.\r\n\r\n129\r\n00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:13,633\r\nAnd he too remains an\r\naccomplished change artist.\r\n\r\n130\r\n00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:18,149\r\nChameleon-like. He also did the\r\nsame with his work, for whatever reason.\r\n\r\n131\r\n00:12:18,245 --> 00:12:20,745\r\nYou only have to look at the\r\nmany versions of the Firebird Suite\r\n\r\n132\r\n00:12:20,797 --> 00:12:25,597\r\nwhere from the same material so many\r\ndifferent combinations were created.\r\n\r\n133\r\n00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,600\r\nYou have that with the other two composers\r\nas well. - Exactly.\r\n\r\n134\r\n00:12:29,673 --> 00:12:34,373\r\nThe continuation of the work in\r\nother works and through other works,\r\n\r\n135\r\n00:12:34,425 --> 00:12:38,525\r\nBoulez used the term proliferation.\r\n\r\n136\r\n00:12:38,654 --> 00:12:46,054\r\nWhen a work variegates and is taken up in\r\nother works. You also find it in Berio.\r\n\r\n137\r\n00:12:46,118 --> 00:12:52,518\r\nBut in fact it is such that all three\r\ncomposers have their own individual face.\r\n\r\n138\r\n00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:57,233\r\nAnd no matter how similar they may be\r\nremain completely different from one another.","cuepoints":null,"transcript":null,"metadata":{"title":"\u6e29\u91cc\u5e0c\u00b7\u970d\u666e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8d6b\u5c14\u5947\u00b7\u683c\u9c81\u5185\u74e6\u5c14\u5fb7","description":"\u5728\u8fd9\u6bb5\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\uff0c\u67cf\u6797\u97f3\u4e50\u8282\u7684\u827a\u672f\u6307\u5bfc\u6e29\u91cc\u5e0c\u00b7\u970d\u666e\u4e0e\u97f3\u4e50\u5b66\u5bb6\u8d6b\u5c14\u5947\u00b7\u683c\u9c81\u5185\u74e6\u5c14\u5fb7\u804a\u8d77\u4e862010\u5e74\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u8282\u3002\u897f\u8499\u00b7\u62c9\u7279\u7235\u58eb\u4e0e\u67cf\u6797\u7231\u4e50\u4e50\u56e2\u4e5f\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e86\u6b64\u6b21\u97f3\u4e50\u8282\u3002"},"_links":{"self":{"href":"\/\/api.digitalconcerthall.com\/v2\/interview\/1623-3"},"category":[{"href":"\/\/api.digitalconcerthall.com\/v2\/category\/13","updated":1663153905,"id":"13","image_variants":{"standard":[{"path":"\/\/images.digitalconcerthall.com\/cms\/thumbnails\/{width}x{height}\/images\/core\/7db62c2395017418cd2918ae0ef7380d.jpg","credit":null,"aspect_ratio_from":0.7,"aspect_ratio_to":1.2,"alt_text":null},{"path":"\/\/images.digitalconcerthall.com\/cms\/thumbnails\/{width}x{height}\/images\/core\/7db62c2395017418cd2918ae0ef7380d.jpg","credit":null,"aspect_ratio_from":1.2,"aspect_ratio_to":1.9,"alt_text":null},{"path":"\/\/images.digitalconcerthall.com\/cms\/thumbnails\/{width}x{height}\/images\/core\/7db62c2395017418cd2918ae0ef7380d.jpg","credit":null,"aspect_ratio_from":1.9,"aspect_ratio_to":2.5,"alt_text":null}]},"name":"\u7279\u8f91","type":"work","count":{"concert":0,"film":0,"interview":55}}],"concert":[{"href":"\/\/api.digitalconcerthall.com\/v2\/concert\/1623","updated":1675246921,"id":"1623","title":"\u897f\u8499\u00b7\u62c9\u7279\u6307\u6325\u65af\u7279\u62c9\u6587\u65af\u57fa\u4e0e\u8d1d\u5229\u5965\u4f5c\u54c1","image_variants":{"standard":[{"path":"\/\/images.digitalconcerthall.com\/cms\/thumbnails\/{width}x{height}\/images\/core\/55aec5a7b166aae4a9f01d3f271de07d.jpg","credit":null,"aspect_ratio_from":0.7,"aspect_ratio_to":1.2,"alt_text":null},{"path":"\/\/images.digitalconcerthall.com\/cms\/thumbnails\/{width}x{height}\/images\/core\/4d10b51e8a20988bad7dd57ec5777182.jpg","credit":null,"aspect_ratio_from":1.2,"aspect_ratio_to":1.9,"alt_text":null},{"path":"\/\/images.digitalconcerthall.com\/cms\/thumbnails\/{width}x{height}\/images\/core\/1acdaaacc0c1dbb4ef9a6b5e3fde8aca.jpg","credit":null,"aspect_ratio_from":1.9,"aspect_ratio_to":2.5,"alt_text":null}]},"is_free":false,"date":{"published":1284314400,"begin":1284314400,"end":1284322200},"image":{"overview":"\/\/images.digitalconcerthall.com\/cms\/thumbnails\/{width}x{height}\/images\/core\/1acdaaacc0c1dbb4ef9a6b5e3fde8aca.jpg","detail":"\/\/images.digitalconcerthall.com\/cms\/thumbnails\/{width}x{height}\/images\/core\/1acdaaacc0c1dbb4ef9a6b5e3fde8aca.jpg"},"blocked_in":[],"additional_broadcasts":null}],"artist":[{"href":"\/\/api.digitalconcerthall.com\/v2\/artist\/360","updated":1676918337,"id":"360","image_variants":{"standard":[{"path":"\/\/images.digitalconcerthall.com\/cms\/thumbnails\/{width}x{height}\/images\/core\/fallback\/artist\/standard-narrow.jpg","credit":null,"aspect_ratio_from":0.7,"aspect_ratio_to":1.2,"alt_text":null},{"path":"\/\/images.digitalconcerthall.com\/cms\/thumbnails\/{width}x{height}\/images\/core\/fallback\/artist\/standard-medium.jpg","credit":null,"aspect_ratio_from":1.2,"aspect_ratio_to":1.9,"alt_text":null},{"path":"\/\/images.digitalconcerthall.com\/cms\/thumbnails\/{width}x{height}\/images\/core\/fallback\/artist\/standard-wide.jpg","credit":null,"aspect_ratio_from":1.9,"aspect_ratio_to":2.5,"alt_text":null}],"profile":[{"path":"\/\/images.digitalconcerthall.com\/cms\/thumbnails\/{width}x{height}\/images\/core\/fallback\/artist\/profile-square.jpg","credit":null,"aspect_ratio_from":1,"aspect_ratio_to":1,"alt_text":null}]},"name":"\u8d6b\u5c14\u5947\u00b7\u683c\u9c81\u5185\u74e6\u5c14\u5fb7","display_name":"\u683c\u9c81\u5185\u74e6\u5c14\u5fb7\u00b7\u8d6b\u5c14\u5947","display_type":"person","name_prefix":"","first_name":"\u8d6b\u5c14\u5947","last_name":"\u683c\u9c81\u5185\u74e6\u5c14\u5fb7","group_name":null,"sort_letter":"G","is_highlighted":false,"fields_of_work":[],"count":{"as_composer":{"work_total":0,"work_vod":0,"work_live":0,"work_in_post_production":0},"as_conductor":{"concert_total":0,"concert_vod":0,"concert_live":0,"concert_in_post_production":0},"as_soloist":{"work_total":0,"work_vod":0,"work_live":0,"work_in_post_production":0},"as_film_participant":{"film":0},"as_interview_participant":{"interview":5}},"fame":0,"role":{"type":"other","name":null}},{"href":"\/\/api.digitalconcerthall.com\/v2\/artist\/380","updated":1676918337,"id":"380","image_variants":{"standard":[{"path":"\/\/images.digitalconcerthall.com\/cms\/thumbnails\/{width}x{height}\/images\/core\/fallback\/artist\/standard-narrow.jpg","credit":null,"aspect_ratio_from":0.7,"aspect_ratio_to":1.2,"alt_text":null},{"path":"\/\/images.digitalconcerthall.com\/cms\/thumbnails\/{width}x{height}\/images\/core\/fallback\/
