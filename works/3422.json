time?\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:51,160\r\nThe first time I came here\r\nto conduct the Venezuelan\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,280\r\nNational Children's Orchestra.\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,910\r\nAnd I remember, you were around,\r\nand you let us to\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,150\r\ncome, few musicians\r\nof the orchestra.\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:04,060\r\nThis was, I think, a rehearsal\r\nof Bruckner Nine.\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,460\r\nAnd then I came to a concert\r\nwhen I came here to study for\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,710\r\nthree months.\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,700\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,270\r\nIt was a Haitink concert.\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,060\r\nBrahms Fourth.\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,150\r\nYou've got a great memory.\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:18,480\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,490\r\nHe was doing Brahms Four.\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,230\r\nAnd I think a special\r\ncomposer.\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,620\r\nHe was doing a symphony for\r\nstrings, I remember.\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,730\r\nDid you get to sit in such a\r\nnice, expensive seat like this\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,220\r\none, or were you standing\r\nup in the back?\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:31,760\r\nNo, no, no.\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,980\r\nI got good tickets.\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,120\r\nYou got good tickets?\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,750\r\nYes, I got good tickets.\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:39,330\r\nBecause that day, I was arising\r\nfrom Venezuela for\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:45,310\r\nthis experience, to assist\r\nSimon, to prepare the Academy\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,040\r\norchestra, I was living\r\nin this place.\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,030\r\nYou were here for three months,\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,040\r\nand you were literally.\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,880\r\nI remember you.\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,650\r\nYou were everywhere.\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,690\r\nDoesn't matter what time of\r\nthe morning or the night.\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,250\r\nI was here.\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,310\r\nYou were always here.\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,800\r\nI was, all the time.\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,530\r\nAnd I remember, I was sleeping\r\nthere on the top.\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,382\r\nUp there in the box?\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:02:00,382 --> 00:02:01,400\r\nDeliciously.\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,550\r\nI have--\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,250\r\nDuring rehearsals, I hope not.\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:04,580\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,700\r\nNot during rehearsals, but\r\nbetween rehearsals.\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:13,320\r\nBecause I was living in the\r\nhouse of a Venezuelan friend,\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,140\r\nThomas Clamor.\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,100\r\nI was living in his house.\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,620\r\nThat was really fun.\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,000\r\nBut they live very far, and it\r\nwas very expensive for me.\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,480\r\nSo I was sleeping here,\r\neating all the time--\r\n\r\n70\r\n00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,590\r\nI remember you were there.\r\n\r\n71\r\n00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,580\r\n--in the cafeteria.\r\n\r\n72\r\n00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:34,850\r\nAnd for me, it's like a house.\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,510\r\nIt's like home.\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,670\r\nBecause I feel like I know every\r\ncorner of this place.\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,990\r\nAnd I was listening to concerts\r\nthere at the top.\r\n\r\n76\r\n00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,840\r\nSometimes I got great\r\ninvitation, I would say.\r\n\r\n77\r\n00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,090\r\nAnd I was sitting here.\r\n\r\n78\r\n00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,260\r\n\r\n79\r\n00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,350\r\nIt's a beautiful part\r\nof my life.\r\n\r\n80\r\n00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,360\r\nThree months is a long time to\r\nstay in one place here in the\r\n\r\n81\r\n00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,150\r\nPhilharmonie for you, because\r\nyou were otherwise traveling\r\n\r\n82\r\n00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,810\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\n83\r\n00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,290\r\nWhat did those three months\r\nbring to you, do you think?\r\n\r\n84\r\n00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,740\r\n\r\n85\r\n00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,510\r\nWell, as you know, I did all\r\nmy musical education in\r\n\r\n86\r\n00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,290\r\nVenezuela, in El Sistema.\r\n\r\n87\r\n00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:22,470\r\nAnd Maestro Abreu and all my\r\nteachers were the basis of all\r\n\r\n88\r\n00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,280\r\nwhat I know about music.\r\n\r\n89\r\n00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:33,400\r\nBut to come here was my first,\r\nlet's say, international\r\n\r\n90\r\n00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,510\r\nout-of-home experience.\r\n\r\n91\r\n00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,690\r\nAnd it was great.\r\n\r\n92\r\n00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:43,790\r\nBecause we grew up listening and\r\nwatching concerts of the\r\n\r\n93\r\n00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,830\r\nBerlin Philharmonic, especially\r\nwith Karajan.\r\n\r\n94\r\n00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,170\r\nWe were playing, for example,\r\nTchaikovsky\r\n\r\n95\r\n00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,240\r\nFour a lot of times.\r\n\r\n96\r\n00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,520\r\nPreparing that as a children's\r\norchestra.\r\n\r\n97\r\n00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,360\r\nAnd which was the video\r\nthat we were watching?\r\n\r\n98\r\n00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,650\r\nThe video of Karajan with\r\nthe Berlin Philharmonic.\r\n\r\n99\r\n00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,670\r\nSo the reference was always\r\nthere, and we had this sound.\r\n\r\n100\r\n00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,840\r\nBut when you come here, it's\r\ndifferent, because it's real.\r\n\r\n101\r\n00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,580\r\nAnd for me, I can say it changed\r\nmy life completely.\r\n\r\n102\r\n00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:17,209\r\nBecause the approach to the\r\nmusic, the sound, the way to\r\n\r\n103\r\n00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:23,530\r\nmake the sound, gave me a\r\ndifferent dimension of how to\r\n\r\n104\r\n00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,630\r\nthink about what I want to\r\nget from the orchestra.\r\n\r\n105\r\n00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,440\r\nBecause I was sitting here\r\nlistening, watching rehearsals\r\n\r\n106\r\n00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:36,600\r\nof Haitink, Barenboim, Rattle,\r\nAbbado, Ozawa--\r\n\r\n107\r\n00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,640\r\nIt's a dream for a\r\nyoung conductor.\r\n\r\n108\r\n00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:37,910\r\n--was at that time.\r\n\r\n109\r\n00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,280\r\nI was like, wow, in\r\nevery rehearsal.\r\n\r\n110\r\n00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,130\r\nAnd it was a luxury for me.\r\n\r\n111\r\n00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,760\r\nBecause you cannot come to a\r\nfirst rehearsal, because you\r\n\r\n112\r\n00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,140\r\nknow-- and that is amazing.\r\n\r\n113\r\n00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,730\r\nBut I was allowed.\r\n\r\n114\r\n00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,280\r\nAnd I was the only one here\r\nlistening, the first rehearsal\r\n\r\n115\r\n00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,300\r\nof the Berlin Philharmonic,\r\nin all the world.\r\n\r\n116\r\n00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,198\r\nWe were playing just for you.\r\n\r\n117\r\n00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:02,330\r\nI was feeling like, oh, God,\r\nI'm the owner of the world.\r\n\r\n118\r\n00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,290\r\nMust have been absolute\r\n\r\n119\r\n00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,820\r\nparadise for a young conductor.\r\n\r\n120\r\n00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,940\r\nBut that is what I recommend\r\nto young conductors.\r\n\r\n121\r\n00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,160\r\nBecause they always come,\r\nand they ask what to do.\r\n\r\n122\r\n00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,450\r\nAn I say, well, it's not a\r\nbetter school than to go and\r\n\r\n123\r\n00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,750\r\nto sit in a rehearsal\r\nof a big conductor.\r\n\r\n124\r\n00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,990\r\nAnd if you have the chance to be\r\nhere in Berlin, and to have\r\n\r\n125\r\n00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,145\r\nthe chance to see,\r\nand to listen.\r\n\r\n126\r\n00:05:29,145 --> 00:05:33,360\r\nEspecially when you close\r\nyour eyes, you get a\r\n\r\n127\r\n00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,330\r\ndifferent kind of energy.\r\n\r\n128\r\n00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,640\r\nThe sound, especially, of the\r\nBerlin Philharmonic is coming\r\n\r\n129\r\n00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,660\r\nfrom the earth.\r\n\r\n130\r\n00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,110\r\nI feel that all the time.\r\n\r\n131\r\n00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,460\r\nIt's not something like,\r\n\"ah!\" it's [LOW GROWL].\r\n\r\n132\r\n00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,460\r\nAnd that is great.\r\n\r\n133\r\n00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,800\r\nIt's another kind of approach.\r\n\r\n134\r\n00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,670\r\nYou grew up with the Berlin\r\nPhilharmonic.\r\n\r\n135\r\n00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,290\r\nBecause everybody knows\r\nthe story about you\r\n\r\n136\r\n00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,940\r\nconducting your toys.\r\n\r\n137\r\n00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,040\r\nYou used to line up your toys\r\nand conduct them to records of\r\n\r\n138\r\n00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,370\r\nBerlin Phil, Vienna Phil.\r\n\r\n139\r\n00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,290\r\nSo you grew up with this\r\nsound, the Berlin Phil.\r\n\r\n140\r\n00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,840\r\nAnd you've done quite a few\r\nprograms now, but this is the\r\n\r\n141\r\n00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,960\r\nfirst true German meat\r\nthat you're doing.\r\n\r\n142\r\n00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:14,130\r\nStrauss is really one of our\r\nbasic repertoire things.\r\n\r\n143\r\n00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:17,540\r\nI think the orchestra plays\r\nStrauss really, really well.\r\n\r\n144\r\n00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,460\r\nDo you?\r\n\r\n145\r\n00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,170\r\nWell, let me tell you.\r\n\r\n146\r\n00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,390\r\nWhen we did last year, the\r\nZarathustra, Also Sprach.\r\n\r\n147\r\n00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,540\r\nAnd now we're doing\r\nDon Juan and Till.\r\n\r\n148\r\n00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,120\r\nBut it was funny, because I was\r\nchecking some things in\r\n\r\n149\r\n00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:43,200\r\nthe string parts, and it said,\r\n\"Time of Dr. Strauss, 29\r\n\r\n150\r\n00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,600\r\nminutes, or 30 minutes, in\r\nvery old-style letters.\r\n\r\n151\r\n00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:47,900\r\nNo!\r\n\r\n152\r\n00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,000\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n153\r\n00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,150\r\nSo this was the old music.\r\n\r\n154\r\n00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,970\r\nAnd Strauss conducted here.\r\n\r\n155\r\n00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,310\r\nHe was 23 when he had his first\r\n\r\n156\r\n00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,185\r\ndebut here as a conductor.\r\n\r\n157\r\n00:06:55,185 --> 00:06:55,300\r\nIncredible.\r\n\r\n158\r\n00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:55,920\r\nCan you imagine that?\r\n\r\n159\r\n00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,380\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n160\r\n00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:56,740\r\nIncredible.\r\n\r\n161\r\n00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:03,700\r\nAnd this date was in\r\nthe '20s or '30s.\r\n\r\n162\r\n00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,350\r\nThen it said Dr. Furtwangler,\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\n163\r\n00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,850\r\nIt's amazing, because you are\r\nlike, oh my God, it's history.\r\n\r\n164\r\n00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,170\r\nIt's tradition.\r\n\r\n165\r\n00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,740\r\nIt's really a tradition.\r\n\r\n166\r\n00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,620\r\nLike, three days ago--\r\n\r\n167\r\n00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,120\r\nfour days ago, I was conducting\r\nthe Vienna\r\n\r\n168\r\n00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,140\r\nPhilharmonic.\r\n\r\n169\r\n00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,030\r\nAnd we we're doing the\r\nSiegfried-Idyll.\r\n\r\n170\r\n00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:29,950\r\nRichter, that was the intendant\r\nat that time, the\r\n\r\n171\r\n00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,530\r\nvery first one, he was the one\r\nthat prepared for Wagner the\r\n\r\n172\r\n00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:39,260\r\nmusicians to play for Cosima,\r\nlike a serenade.\r\n\r\n173\r\n00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,600\r\nAnd it's funny, because I had\r\nthe score, I opened, and it\r\n\r\n174\r\n00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,870\r\nhas a paper that says, Richter\r\nconducting, Richter, Strauss\r\n\r\n175\r\n00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,060\r\nconducting--\r\n\r\n176\r\n00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,960\r\nthis kind of reference, when I\r\ngo here to the archives and I\r\n\r\n177\r\n00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,880\r\ncan see Karajan's, 'Boim,\r\nAbbado, Furtwangler--\r\n\r\n178\r\n00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,000\r\nyou're talking about the\r\nsoul of this music.\r\n\r\n179\r\n00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,260\r\nAnd this is a challenge, as a\r\nyoung musician, to-- well,\r\n\r\n180\r\n00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,260\r\nso-so, because I'm already 32.\r\n\r\n181\r\n00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,060\r\nYeah, you're getting on a bit.\r\n\r\n182\r\n00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,310\r\nBut when you come here,\r\nyou have to know\r\n\r\n183\r\n00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,240\r\nwhat you want to get.\r\n\r\n184\r\n00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,080\r\nBecause of course, there\r\nare not musicians\r\n\r\n185\r\n00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,710\r\nhere from that time.\r\n\r\n186\r\n00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,880\r\nBut they all learned from\r\nthe ones before.\r\n\r\n187\r\n00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:28,955\r\nExactly.\r\n\r\n188\r\n00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:30,130\r\nIt's the tradition.\r\n\r\n189\r\n00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:35,020\r\nSo you need to be really\r\nwell-prepared, very clear with\r\n\r\n190\r\n00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,850\r\nyour ideas, but also open to\r\nreceive what the orchestra is\r\n\r\n191\r\n00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:39,970\r\ngiving to you.\r\n\r\n192\r\n00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,120\r\nDo you feel that tradition?\r\n\r\n193\r\n00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,610\r\nDo you hear?\r\n\r\n194\r\n00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,890\r\nIs that what you got on\r\nstage, do you think?\r\n\r\n195\r\n00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,620\r\nAbsolutely.\r\n\r\n196\r\n00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:50,630\r\nAnd you have in mind a tempo,\r\nbut that tempo change because\r\n\r\n197\r\n00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,380\r\nthe way to produce the sound\r\nof the orchestra, and\r\n\r\n198\r\n00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,960\r\nthen you say, OK.\r\n\r\n199\r\n00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,940\r\nThis has to be like that.\r\n\r\n200\r\n00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,580\r\nWhat is it that makes different\r\norchestras have\r\n\r\n201\r\n00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,280\r\nthese different souls,\r\ndo you think?\r\n\r\n202\r\n00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:08,070\r\nWell, I think it's beautiful,\r\nand has to be like that.\r\n\r\n203\r\n00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:13,170\r\nBecause if all the orchestras\r\nplayed it in the same way, it\r\n\r\n204\r\n00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,460\r\nwould be really boring.\r\n\r\n205\r\n00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:22,510\r\nAnd for us as conductors,\r\nespecially coming as a guest\r\n\r\n206\r\n00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:29,130\r\nconductor, you try--\r\n\r\n207\r\n00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,200\r\nit is my conception--\r\n\r\n208\r\n00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,130\r\nI try to respect a lot what I\r\nhave from, of course, the\r\n\r\n209\r\n00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:42,430\r\nmusicians, and the way they\r\nproduce the sound.\r\n\r\n210\r\n00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,130\r\nBecause you can come in, you can\r\nknow about everything, and\r\n\r\n211\r\n00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,280\r\nyou are there.\r\n\r\n212\r\n00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,750\r\nBut you have to know that you\r\nhave to deal with this energy\r\n\r\n213\r\n00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,780\r\nthat is magic.\r\n\r\n214\r\n00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,700\r\nBecause it's not only to\r\nmove your hands in\r\n\r\n215\r\n00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,380\r\nfront of the orchestra.\r\n\r\n216\r\n00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,570\r\nI think the musicians, you feel\r\nin the moment, in the\r\n\r\n217\r\n00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,020\r\neyes of the conductor, if he\r\nknows what he's saying.\r\n\r\n218\r\n00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,690\r\nOh, certainly.\r\n\r\n219\r\n00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,570\r\nAnd that is something--\r\n\r\n220\r\n00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,690\r\nThey know that before he's\r\neven done a beat.\r\n\r\n221\r\n00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,140\r\nExactly.\r\n\r\n222\r\n00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,860\r\nBy the time he comes in here\r\nand walks along, yeah.\r\n\r\n223\r\n00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,080\r\nYou are like, hmm, no.\r\n\r\n224\r\n00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,900\r\nAnd I know that because I\r\nplayed in an orchestra.\r\n\r\n225\r\n00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:23,530\r\nAnd for me, it was all the time\r\nexcited to see, wow, what\r\n\r\n226\r\n00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,800\r\nthis guy is giving?\r\n\r\n227\r\n00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,860\r\nFor you here, you have the best\r\nconductors coming, and\r\n\r\n228\r\n00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,000\r\nit's so great.\r\n\r\n229\r\n00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,070\r\nBut I think, also, this\r\norchestra has this amazing\r\n\r\n230\r\n00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:38,590\r\nhall, that it's like to\r\nhave an instrument.\r\n\r\n231\r\n00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:41,960\r\nAnd you create and you\r\nadapt your sound.\r\n\r\n232\r\n00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,410\r\nAnd now, this place is a\r\nreference for the new\r\n\r\n233\r\n00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,710\r\nbuildings around the world.\r\n\r\n234\r\n00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:52,600\r\nBecause this kind of seating,\r\nwhere the orchestra is going\r\n\r\n235\r\n00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,452\r\nup, this creates a chamberistic\r\nway of playing.\r\n\r\n236\r\n00:10:57,452 --> 00:10:59,880\r\nEven if you are conducting,\r\nyou see that everybody's\r\n\r\n237\r\n00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,800\r\nlistening to each other.\r\n\r\n238\r\n00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,530\r\nI love, sometimes, to see videos\r\nwhen I see a violin\r\n\r\n239\r\n00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:10,540\r\nwatching the woodwind section,\r\nand it's coming a solo.\r\n\r\n240\r\n00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,830\r\nBecause everybody has\r\nknowledge of that.\r\n\r\n241\r\n00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:18,030\r\nAnd of course, you can not\r\navoid, again, going back to\r\n\r\n242\r\n00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,850\r\nthat tradition.\r\n\r\n243\r\n00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,430\r\nThis kind of, well--\r\n\r\n244\r\n00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,890\r\nStrauss is our repertoire.\r\n\r\n245\r\n00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:30,520\r\nBeethoven, Wagner, Mahler--\r\n\r\n246\r\n00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,210\r\nwell, all of them.\r\n\r\n247\r\n00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:36,660\r\nIt's something that is in the\r\nblood of the orchestra.\r\n\r\n248\r\n00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,440\r\nAnd I think--\r\n\r\n249\r\n00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,835\r\nSo did you choose this program\r\nfor this orchestra?\r\n\r\n250\r\n00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:46,540\r\nWell, I think I'm very careful\r\nwith the repertoire that I do,\r\n\r\n251\r\n00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:51,470\r\nespecially with an orchestra\r\nlike the Berlin Philharmonic.\r\n\r\n252\r\n00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,390\r\nYou're talking a top orchestra,\r\nso you cannot come\r\n\r\n253\r\n00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:58,970\r\nhere the first time and do\r\nBeethoven, or Strauss.\r\n\r\n254\r\n00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,000\r\nBecause I was really careful.\r\n\r\n255\r\n00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,940\r\nMy first program was\r\nLatin music.\r\n\r\n256\r\n00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,490\r\nIt was, yeah.\r\n\r\n257\r\n00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,310\r\nIt was.\r\n\r\n258\r\n00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,260\r\nIn many pieces--\r\n\r\n259\r\n00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,690\r\nYou gave us a hard--\r\n\r\n260\r\n00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,870\r\nit was hard for us, because you\r\nexpected us to play these\r\n\r\n261\r\n00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,700\r\npieces within two days that we'd\r\nnever even seen before.\r\n\r\n262\r\n00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,610\r\nBut you did really well.\r\n\r\n263\r\n00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,070\r\nAnd the second time, I came\r\nwith a piece that was--\r\n\r\n264\r\n00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:23,540\r\nit's a very famous recording\r\nwith Karajan, with Ozawa--\r\n\r\n265\r\n00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,950\r\nof Prokofiev Fifth.\r\n\r\n266\r\n00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,540\r\nProkofiev Fifth, it's good,\r\nwith Rachmaninov and\r\n\r\n267\r\n00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,980\r\nStravinsky.\r\n\r\n268\r\n00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,340\r\nThen I came, again, back\r\nwith Shostakovitch.\r\n\r\n269\r\n00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,070\r\nAnd now, last year, I\r\ndid for the first\r\n\r\n270\r\n00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,250\r\ntime Strauss and Beethoven.\r\n\r\n271\r\n00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:44,450\r\nSo that is trying to\r\nbuild a relation.\r\n\r\n272\r\n00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:51,740\r\nI will not cook for you, the\r\nfirst time, a very complex, I\r\n\r\n273\r\n00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,752\r\ndon't know, Berliner--\r\n\r\n274\r\n00:12:53,752 --> 00:12:56,476\r\n\r\n275\r\n00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,130\r\nI don't know--\r\n\r\n276\r\n00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,000\r\nplate, you know?\r\n\r\n277\r\n00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,470\r\nDish.\r\n\r\n278\r\n00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,090\r\nFirst, I will cook for you\r\nwhat I know to cook.\r\n\r\n279\r\n00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,370\r\nAnd then I will prepare\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n280\r\n00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,350\r\nAnd it has been great.\r\n\r\n281\r\n00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:11,570\r\nBecause the evolution of the\r\nrelation is so natural.\r\n\r\n282\r\n00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,140\r\nAnd I feel that, when\r\nI come here,\r\n\r\n283\r\n00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,550\r\neverything seems very natural.\r\n\r\n284\r\n00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,220\r\nSometimes, I don't have\r\nto say things.\r\n\r\n285\r\n00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,510\r\nI have an example.\r\n\r\n286\r\n00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:27,380\r\nBecause I use sometimes a lot of\r\nmetaphors to explain what I\r\n\r\n287\r\n00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,300\r\nwant to have, or how\r\nto see the things.\r\n\r\n288\r\n00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,150\r\nAnd everybody's listening.\r\n\r\n289\r\n00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,010\r\nYou receive, I receive.\r\n\r\n290\r\n00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:40,560\r\nSo I really feel like you can\r\nfeel part of the family.\r\n\r\n291\r\n00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,150\r\nBecause when I was sleeping\r\nhere, learning, assisting\r\n\r\n292\r\n00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:49,245\r\nSimon, watching, bringing,\r\ncoming listening to here, it's\r\n\r\n293\r\n00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,890\r\nlike, well.\r\n\r\n294\r\n00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,250\r\nSo, working with the orchestra,\r\nyou say that the\r\n\r\n295\r\n00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,820\r\nconductors have to know\r\nit inside-out\r\n\r\n296\r\n00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,580\r\nbefore they stand here.\r\n\r\n297\r\n00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,770\r\nThat's absolutely the case.\r\n\r\n298\r\n00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,480\r\nBut you take it to\r\nanother level.\r\n\r\n299\r\n00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,360\r\nYou rehearse from memory.\r\n\r\n300\r\n00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,060\r\nAnd today in the rehearsal, it's\r\nlike you could see your\r\n\r\n301\r\n00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,780\r\nbrain working.\r\n\r\n302\r\n00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,015\r\nBecause you mentioned a place,\r\nand then you thought, oh,\r\n\r\n303\r\n00:14:06,015 --> 00:14:07,850\r\nthere's something else\r\nI wanted to mention.\r\n\r\n304\r\n00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,016\r\nAnd you shut your eyes and you\r\nwent, [CLICKING NOISES].\r\n\r\n305\r\n00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,880\r\nAnd you were scanning\r\nthe whole score.\r\n\r\n306\r\n00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,890\r\nAnd then, [CLICK]--\r\n\r\n307\r\n00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:13,130\r\nAh, yeah.\r\n\r\n308\r\n00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:13,880\r\nI've got it.\r\n\r\n309\r\n00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,910\r\nSo you rehearse from\r\nmemory as well.\r\n\r\n310\r\n00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,790\r\nWell, yes.\r\n\r\n311\r\n00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,890\r\nCrazy man.\r\n\r\n312\r\n00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,030\r\nThat's wonderful.\r\n\r\n313\r\n00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:27,120\r\nNo, but, look, I don't see\r\nthat as a special talent.\r\n\r\n314\r\n00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,710\r\nMany conductors conduct\r\nby memory.\r\n\r\n315\r\n00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,280\r\nAnd other conductors, they\r\nconduct with the music, and\r\n\r\n316\r\n00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,460\r\nthey are also great.\r\n\r\n317\r\n00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,220\r\nYeah, but to conduct without the\r\nmusic, that's one thing.\r\n\r\n318\r\n00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,860\r\nBut to rehearse without the\r\nmusic, and know the bar\r\n\r\n319\r\n00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,670\r\nnumbers where everyone\r\nshould stop, that's\r\n\r\n320\r\n00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,450\r\nvery impressive, anyway.\r\n\r\n321\r\n00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:46,060\r\nWell, look.\r\n\r\n322\r\n00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,650\r\nThis can sound like a cliche,\r\nbut music is my life.\r\n\r\n323\r\n00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,210\r\nAnd I always say that.\r\n\r\n324\r\n00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:55,560\r\nAnd for me, it's so important\r\nto be always very\r\n\r\n325\r\n00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,390\r\nwell-prepared.\r\n\r\n326\r\n00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,250\r\nAnd I'm studying.\r\n\r\n327\r\n00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:02,910\r\nAnd of course I have, let's\r\nsay, a photographic memory\r\n\r\n328\r\n00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,040\r\nthat I can remember.\r\n\r\n329\r\n00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,330\r\nAlso a reference of the sound.\r\n\r\n330\r\n00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:11,250\r\nAnd sometimes, when I'm trying\r\nto see, I try to pass the\r\n\r\n331\r\n00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,755\r\npages and to see where I am.\r\n\r\n332\r\n00:15:13,755 --> 00:15:16,490\r\nIt's something like\r\na way to study.\r\n\r\n333\r\n00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,720\r\nSo I--\r\n\r\n334\r\n00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,010\r\nWe love these little things that\r\nhappen on the stage, with\r\n\r\n335\r\n00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,230\r\nconductors we like.\r\n\r\n336\r\n00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:26,360\r\nSo we've got Till Eulenspiegel\r\nand Don Juan.\r\n\r\n337\r\n00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,550\r\nVery nice horn program.\r\n\r\n338\r\n00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,080\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\n339\r\n00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,340\r\nBecause the horns are the\r\nheroes of both pieces.\r\n\r\n340\r\n00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,950\r\nThey're Till Eulenspiegel\r\nand Don Juan.\r\n\r\n341\r\n00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,100\r\nSo what would you say?\r\n\r\n342\r\n00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,330\r\nAre you more a Till Eulenspiegel\r\nor a Don Juan?\r\n\r\n343\r\n00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:40,230\r\n\r\n344\r\n00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,860\r\nWell, I have to say--\r\n\r\n345\r\n00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,850\r\nOh, your voice is getting\r\ndeeper now.\r\n\r\n346\r\n00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,100\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n347\r\n00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,160\r\n\r\n348\r\n00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,330\r\nAnd of course, I hope\r\nmy wife is not--\r\n\r\n349\r\n00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,770\r\nif I say Don Juan, I\r\nwill be problems.\r\n\r\n350\r\n00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,890\r\nWell, how about Don\r\nEulenspiegel, or--\r\n\r\n351\r\n00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,590\r\nTill Juan.\r\n\r\n352\r\n00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,320\r\nTill Juan or Don Eulenspiegel.\r\n\r\n353\r\n00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,250\r\nOr Don Till.\r\n\r\n354\r\n00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:02,680\r\nDon Till.\r\n\r\n355\r\n00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,930\r\nDo you imagine these characters\r\non stage while\r\n\r\n356\r\n00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:06,450\r\nyou're conducting?\r\n\r\n357\r\n00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,740\r\nAbsolutely.\r\n\r\n358\r\n00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,815\r\nYou become these--\r\n\r\n359\r\n00:16:08,815 --> 00:16:10,250\r\nBut we have to.\r\n\r\n360\r\n00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,200\r\nBecause it's like, to\r\nread any story.\r\n\r\n361\r\n00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:18,220\r\nIt's like, say, and for the\r\npeople to laugh, or to suffer\r\n\r\n362\r\n00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,740\r\nin a short time.\r\n\r\n363\r\n00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:24,660\r\nBecause I think for Till, for\r\nStrauss it was an idea to\r\n\r\n364\r\n00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,420\r\nwrite an opera about\r\nthe character.\r\n\r\n365\r\n00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,290\r\nBut he didn't go to write the\r\nopera, and he wrote the piece.\r\n\r\n366\r\n00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,490\r\nAnd it's so funny.\r\n\r\n367\r\n00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:39,270\r\nBecause in such a short time,\r\nyou show many, many--\r\n\r\n368\r\n00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,160\r\nhow to say--\r\n\r\n369\r\n00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,430\r\nmany--\r\n\r\n370\r\n00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:41,546\r\nPictures.\r\n\r\n371\r\n00:16:41,546 --> 00:16:41,780\r\nHe paints--\r\n\r\n372\r\n00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,165\r\nElements.\r\n\r\n373\r\n00:16:42,165 --> 00:16:42,550\r\nExactly.\r\n\r\n374\r\n00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,450\r\n--the pictures.\r\n\r\n375\r\n00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,080\r\nAnd also of the character.\r\n\r\n376\r\n00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,820\r\nThis crazy character, playful\r\ncharacter, making all this--\r\n\r\n377\r\n00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,030\r\nlike a bully, you know, trying\r\nto do bad things all the time.\r\n\r\n378\r\n00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,430\r\nAnd you have to show that.\r\n\r\n379\r\n00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,170\r\nPeople have to laugh.\r\n\r\n380\r\n00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,740\r\nAnd the people have to\r\nsee when he's dying.\r\n\r\n381\r\n00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,190\r\nYou know, that--\r\n\r\n382\r\n00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:01,720\r\nthis place.\r\n\r\n383\r\n00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,280\r\nThe same in Don Juan.\r\n\r\n384\r\n00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,359\r\nIt's one of the most amazing\r\nbeginnings in\r\n\r\n385\r\n00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,319\r\nthe history of music.\r\n\r\n386\r\n00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,089\r\nIt really is.\r\n\r\n387\r\n00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:10,560\r\nNothing has it.\r\n\r\n388\r\n00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,150\r\nI was thinking that today\r\nin the rehearsal.\r\n\r\n389\r\n00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,359\r\nIt's thrust.\r\n\r\n390\r\n00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,670\r\nAnd here is the character\r\nof this guy.\r\n\r\n391\r\n00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,978\r\nBut also, you see the love,\r\nthe charming love.\r\n\r\n392\r\n00:17:20,978 --> 00:17:24,230\r\nYou can even smell the music.\r\n\r\n393\r\n00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:28,200\r\nYou can get the air, and study,\r\ntoo, the darkness, the\r\n\r\n394\r\n00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,690\r\ndarkness of the character.\r\n\r\n395\r\n00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,360\r\nYou know, the bad side.\r\n\r\n396\r\n00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:37,240\r\nSo, of course, what we have to\r\ndo all the time playing this\r\n\r\n397\r\n00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,140\r\nmusic is to show and to tell\r\nthe history with notes.\r\n\r\n398\r\n00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:47,030\r\nAnd as a universal language,\r\neverybody understands that.\r\n\r\n399\r\n00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,555\r\nYou don't have to\r\nspeak German.\r\n\r\n400\r\n00:17:48,555 --> 00:17:52,210\r\nYou don't have to speak English,\r\nSpanish, Chinese, no.\r\n\r\n401\r\n00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:52,880\r\nNotes.\r\n\r\n402\r\n00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,200\r\nMusic.\r\n\r\n403\r\n00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,690\r\nAnd people receive that.\r\n\r\n404\r\n00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,200\r\nHow did the Barber\r\nget in there?\r\n\r\n405\r\n00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,990\r\nA bit of--\r\n\r\n406\r\n00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:02,470\r\nI know it wasn't done for film\r\nmusic, but I know it, and\r\n\r\n407\r\n00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,600\r\npeople know it from\r\nthis film Platoon.\r\n\r\n408\r\n00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,220\r\nYes, Platoon.\r\n\r\n409\r\n00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:13,520\r\nLook, Barber Adagio\r\nis this kind of\r\n\r\n410\r\n00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,040\r\nsuspension of the time.\r\n\r\n411\r\n00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:22,800\r\nIt's no time, is what\r\nI see in this music.\r\n\r\n412\r\n00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,400\r\nBecause you start from the\r\nsilence, and then you finish\r\n\r\n413\r\n00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,460\r\nfor the silence.\r\n\r\n414\r\n00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,900\r\nAnd what you get is a climax.\r\n\r\n415\r\n00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,250\r\nYou go to a top, very\r\nintense climax, and\r\n\r\n416\r\n00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,510\r\nthen again into nothing.\r\n\r\n417\r\n00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:44,450\r\nMy approach to the piece, and\r\nhaving a piece that I love, as\r\n\r\n418\r\n00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,920\r\nI'm a string player, of course,\r\nI love the piece.\r\n\r\n419\r\n00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,240\r\nBut also, this--\r\n\r\n420\r\n00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,220\r\nI don't know how to say--\r\n\r\n421\r\n00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:57,830\r\nuntemporal, no-time,\r\nfloating feeling.\r\n\r\n422\r\n00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,610\r\nIt's such a powerful thing.\r\n\r\n423\r\n00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:08,070\r\nAnd, too, with these string\r\ngroup, that all of them are\r\n\r\n424\r\n00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,760\r\nsoloists, they are so great, and\r\nthey intact so great as a\r\n\r\n425\r\n00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,240\r\nchamber music, is great.\r\n\r\n426\r\n00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,470\r\nI think I saw--\r\n\r\n427\r\n00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,400\r\nit's a great program.\r\n\r\n428\r\n00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:23,860\r\nThe combination of the Barber\r\nand the Strauss, because you\r\n\r\n429\r\n00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,810\r\nget all of this.\r\n\r\n430\r\n00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:30,185\r\nYou go from this suspension, I\r\ndon't know, floating feeling,\r\n\r\n431\r\n00:19:30,185 --> 00:19:36,216\r\nto these very crazy histories\r\nof Don Juan and Till.\r\n\r\n432\r\n00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,480\r\nAnd I think it's a perfect--\r\n\r\n433\r\n00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,830\r\nWe love doing it with you.\r\n\r\n434\r\n00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,900\r\nAnd also, the viewers of\r\nthe Digital Concert\r\n\r\n435\r\n00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,550\r\nHall are loving it.\r\n\r\n436\r\n00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,050\r\nThey got from you a present--\r\n\r\n437\r\n00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,885\r\n1,000 passes to watch\r\nthis concert.\r\n\r\n438\r\n00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:51,930\r\nSo the viewer are going\r\nto be a lot tonight.\r\n\r\n439\r\n00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,260\r\nSo we're really happy\r\nabout that.\r\n\r\n440\r\n00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,370\r\nYou're really fantastic in\r\nall this modern music\r\n\r\n441\r\n00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,580\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n442\r\n00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,750\r\nYou're easy for an interviewer\r\nto find out about.\r\n\r\n443\r\n00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,470\r\nBecause you're all over YouTube,\r\nand you've got a\r\n\r\n444\r\n00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,280\r\ngreat Facebook following, a\r\nTwitter following, and it's\r\n\r\n445\r\n00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,010\r\njust fantastic what you're\r\ndoing for young people.\r\n\r\n446\r\n00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:09,800\r\nNo, well, what you are doing.\r\n\r\n447\r\n00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,530\r\nBecause it's very important.\r\n\r\n448\r\n00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:15,040\r\nAnd I always give the example\r\nof the digital concert.\r\n\r\n449\r\n00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:20,150\r\nBecause it's amazing that people\r\nthat cannot come to a\r\n\r\n450\r\n00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,000\r\nconcert, or--\r\n\r\n451\r\n00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,920\r\nOr your friends in Venezuela.\r\n\r\n452\r\n00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,590\r\nExactly.\r\n\r\n453\r\n00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,380\r\nIn Venezuela.\r\n\r\n454\r\n00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,440\r\nOr in China.\r\n\r\n455\r\n00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,340\r\nOr in Japan.\r\n\r\n456\r\n00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,340\r\nThey are really far--\r\n\r\n457\r\n00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,130\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\n458\r\n00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:30,380\r\nAnd they can listen, to see and\r\nto listen with quality--\r\n\r\n459\r\n00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:30,890\r\nAnd live.\r\n\r\n460\r\n00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:31,950\r\nAnd live.\r\n\r\n461\r\n00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:32,600\r\nA concert.\r\n\r\n462\r\n00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,290\r\nSo this is the future.\r\n\r\n463\r\n00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:40,720\r\nAnd of course, for me, that is\r\nsomething very important.\r\n\r\n464\r\n00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,850\r\nBecause education, also, is\r\na very important element.\r\n\r\n465\r\n00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,470\r\nBecause you can get\r\nthe tradition.\r\n\r\n466\r\n00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,590\r\nWhen I came here--\r\n\r\n467\r\n00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,070\r\nof course, it's not\r\nalmost the same.\r\n\r\n468\r\n00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:55,800\r\nBut you can listen a concert.\r\n\r\n469\r\n00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:02,210\r\nI love when, before the concert\r\nis ready, you put a\r\n\r\n470\r\n00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,700\r\nlittle bit of the\r\nrehearsal there.\r\n\r\n471\r\n00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,890\r\nSo people get to listen,\r\nand to see a\r\n\r\n472\r\n00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,070\r\nlittle bit of the rehearsal.\r\n\r\n473\r\n00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,705\r\nThey love the backstage.\r\n\r\n474\r\n00:21:08,705 --> 00:21:11,670\r\nThey love the inside backstage\r\nthings, don't they?\r\n\r\n475\r\n00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,050\r\nAnd, well, this is the future.\r\n\r\n476\r\n00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,900\r\nI think it's part\r\nof the future.\r\n\r\n477\r\n00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,670\r\nLive people coming to listen\r\nto a concert, but also--\r\n\r\n478\r\n00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,980\r\nYou can't beat a live concert.\r\n\r\n479\r\n00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,910\r\nThat's our intention, is to show\r\neverybody who can't come\r\n\r\n480\r\n00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:22,830\r\nhow great it is.\r\n\r\n481\r\n00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,230\r\nAnd then we've had\r\nthis on tours.\r\n\r\n482\r\n00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:27,800\r\nPeople come to our concerts on\r\ntours who watch the Digital\r\n\r\n483\r\n00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,660\r\nConcert Hall, usually.\r\n\r\n484\r\n00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,030\r\nAnd we come to their country,\r\nthey buy a ticket, they come.\r\n\r\n485\r\n00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,580\r\nSo it is working.\r\n\r\n486\r\n00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,890\r\nIt's very important.\r\n\r\n487\r\n00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,150\r\nAnd it's a symbol of future.\r\n\r\n488\r\n00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,790\r\nWell, I'm glad all your fans\r\nare going to be watching.\r\n\r\n489\r\n00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,590\r\nWill little Martin be watching,\r\ndo you think?\r\n\r\n490\r\n00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,400\r\nAbsolutely.\r\n\r\n491\r\n00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,440\r\nI wanted to ask you, does he\r\nconduct his toys like you do?\r\n\r\n492\r\n00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,830\r\nWell, he--\r\n\r\n493\r\n00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,495\r\nI don't know.\r\n\r\n494\r\n00:21:47,495 --> 00:21:48,600\r\nHow old is he now, two?\r\n\r\n495\r\n00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,270\r\nAlmost two.\r\n\r\n496\r\n00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:49,520\r\nAlmost two.\r\n\r\n497\r\n00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,910\r\nAlmost two.\r\n\r\n498\r\n00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,736\r\nIn April 1st, he will be two.\r\n\r\n499\r\n00:21:54,736 --> 00:21:55,800\r\nHe's amazing.\r\n\r\n500\r\n00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,490\r\nHe's changed my life.\r\n\r\n501\r\n00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:06,180\r\nAnd I hope for him to make the\r\nbest decisions in his life.\r\n\r\n502\r\n00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,670\r\nIf he's a musician, beautiful.\r\n\r\n503\r\n00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,290\r\nFootball player's\r\nalso good, eh?\r\n\r\n504\r\n00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:11,600\r\nIf he's a football--\r\n\r\n505\r\n00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,190\r\nIf he's a dancer like his\r\nmother, it's great.\r\n\r\n506\r\n00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,490\r\nIf he's a lawyer, if\r\nhe's a shoemaker, I\r\n\r\n507\r\n00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,480\r\nwill be very happy.\r\n\r\n508\r\n00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,240\r\nI would love for him to do--\r\n\r\n509\r\n00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,430\r\nthat he can see of what I do\r\nthat I do with love and with\r\n\r\n510\r\n00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,520\r\npassion, and with the\r\ncommitment and with\r\n\r\n511\r\n00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,100\r\nresponsibility that you need to\r\nhave to do the things that\r\n\r\n512\r\n00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:39,696\r\nyou do, as Eloisa also do with\r\nthe things that she does.\r\n\r\n513\r\n00:22:39,696 --> 00:22:42,100\r\nBut if he's a conductor,\r\nwonderful.\r\n\r\n514\r\n00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,330\r\nSo he's not conducting\r\nhis toys yet.\r\n\r\n515\r\n00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,040\r\nBut he'd probably conduct with\r\nan iPhone rather than with a\r\n\r\n516\r\n00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,320\r\nbaton, I think.\r\n\r\n517\r\n00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:54,070\r\nMy grandmother gave him a car,\r\nwhere you press a button, and\r\n\r\n518\r\n00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:57,950\r\nit's coming some Bizet Carmen\r\nmusic, and all of that.\r\n\r\n519\r\n00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,040\r\nIt's so funny.\r\n\r\n520\r\n00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,260\r\nAnd he takes a baton.\r\n\r\n521\r\n00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:06,070\r\nSince he was very small, he\r\nwas always taking this and\r\n\r\n522\r\n00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,590\r\ndoing this.\r\n\r\n523\r\n00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,090\r\nThe baton?\r\n\r\n524\r\n00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:07,880\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n525\r\n00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,440\r\nAnd we built a paper\r\none because it was\r\n\r\n526\r\n00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,070\r\ndangerous for him.\r\n\r\n527\r\n00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,220\r\nAnd he was all the\r\ntime like that.\r\n\r\n528\r\n00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,070\r\nIt's beautiful.\r\n\r\n529\r\n00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,250\r\nI feel very proud of that.\r\n\r\n530\r\n00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:23,260\r\nBut if he decides to do\r\nwhatever he wants,\r\n\r\n531\r\n00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,250\r\nI will be so happy.\r\n\r\n532\r\n00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,010\r\nBecause I'm completely\r\nin love.\r\n\r\n533\r\n00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,790\r\nCompletely.\r\n\r\n534\r\n00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,240\r\nWell, I hope we see him soon\r\nhere in the Philharmonie.\r\n\r\n535\r\n00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,840\r\nYou have to bring him to a\r\nchildren's concert, and we'll\r\n\r\n536\r\n00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,195\r\nlet him run around.\r\n\r\n537\r\n00:23:35,195 --> 00:23:36,740\r\nHe will be sitting there\r\non the stage.\r\n\r\n538\r\n00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,020\r\nVery good.\r\n\r\n539\r\n00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,070\r\nGustavo, thank you so much.\r\n\r\n540\r\n00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,370\r\nIt's been a
